"In Swedish families with hereditary prostate cancer, linkage to the HPC1 locus on chromosome 1q24-25 is restricted to families with early-onset prostate cancer. Prostate cancer clusters in some families , and an estimated 5 % -10 % of all cases are estimated to result from inheritance of prostate cancer-susceptibility genes . We previously reported evidence of linkage to the 1q24-25 region ( HPC1 ) in 91 North American and Swedish families each with multiple cases of prostate cancer ( Smith et al . 1996 ) .

"Hemolytic-uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quinine. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon, with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the literature. We describe a 5th case. The reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quinine. Treatment has included use of plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. The patients have all regained some degree of renal function. However, it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the improvement. Quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recognized. It is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure, since the reaction seems to be recurrent.",0,1,1,0

"Procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. Seven cases of procainamide-induced polymorphous ventricular tachycardia are presented. In four patients, polymorphous ventricular tachycardia appeared after intravenous administration of 200 to 400 mg of procainamide for the treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia. In the remaining three patients, procainamide was administered orally for treatment of chronic premature ventricular contractions or atrial flutter. These patients had Q-T prolongation and recurrent syncope due to polymorphous ventricular tachycardia. In four patients, the arrhythmia was rapidly diagnosed and treated with disappearance of further episodes of the arrhythmia. In two patients, the arrhythmia degenerated into irreversible ventricular fibrillation and both patients died.

"Upregulation of brain expression of P-glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(-) rats resembles seizure-induced up-regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats. PURPOSE: The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood-brain barrier (BBB). MRP2 is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant, so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of MRP2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB. However, one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur. This prompted us to study the brain expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues, including the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared with nonmutant (wild-type) Wistar rats. METHODS: The expression of MRP2 and Pgp in brain and liver sections of TR(-) rats and normal Wistar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry, by using a novel, highly selective monoclonal MRP2 antibody and the monoclonal Pgp antibody C219, respectively. RESULTS: Immunofluorescence staining with the MRP2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal Wistar rats, whereas such labeling was absent in TR(-) rats. TR(-) rats exhibited a significant up-regulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild-type controls. No such obvious upregulation of Pgp was observed in liver sections. A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. CONCLUSIONS: The data on TR(-) rats indicate that Pgp plays an important role in the compensation of MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds, the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB. Furthermore, our data suggest that TR(-) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain, without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing events for this purpose.",0,1,1,0

"Homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia: a disease distinct from abetalipoproproteinemia at the molecular level. apoB DNA , RNA , and protein from two patients with homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia ( HBL ) were evaluated and compared with normal individuals . Southern blot analysis with 10 different cDNA probes revealed a normal gene without major insertions , deletions , or rearrangements . Northern and slot blot analyses of total liver mRNA from HBL patients documented a normal size apoB mRNA that was present in greatly reduced quantities . ApoB protein was detected within HBL hepatocytes utilizing immunohistochemical techniques ; however , it was markedly reduced in quantity when compared with control samples . No apoB was detectable in the plasma of HBL individuals with an ELISA assay . These data are most consistent with a mutation in the coding portion of the apoB gene in HBL patients , leading to an abnormal apoB protein and apoB mRNA instability .

Spontaneous reversion of novel Lesch-Nyhan mutation by HPRT gene rearrangement. Molecular analysis of an unusual patient with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome has suggested that the mutation is due to a partial HPRT gene duplication . We now report the cloning and sequencing of the mutant HPRT cDNA which shows the precise duplication of exons 2 and 3 . This mutation is the result of an internal duplication of 16-20 kilobases of the gene . The structure of the mutant gene suggests that the duplication was not generated by a single unequal crossing-over event between two normal HPRT alleles . Growth of Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts from this patient in selective medium has permitted isolation of spontaneous HPRT + revertants of this mutation . The reversion event involves a second major HPRT gene rearrangement where most or all of the duplicated portion of the mutant gene is deleted . The original mutation therefore has the potential for spontaneous somatic reversion . This may explain the relatively mild symptoms of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibited by this patient . .,0,0,1,0
"High-dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVES: To study the long-term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women. METHODS: In a population-based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54-67 years, we studied the association between self-reported intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (estradiol- and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta, which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis. Hormone therapy users were compared with never users. RESULTS: Intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 women. In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present (n=11), while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% (OR 3.1; 95% CI, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, years since menopause, smoking, and body mass index). The association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes, cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol use. No association was found for hormone use less than 1 year. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that high-dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harmless.",1,0,0,0
"Effect of doxorubicin on [omega-I-131]heptadecanoic acid myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dogs. The effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with [omega-I-131]heptadecanoic acid (I-131 HA), and on global left-ventricular function determined echocardiographically, were studied in a group of nine mongrel dogs. Total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin-treated dogs. A significant and then progressive fall in global LV function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg/kg. A significant increase in the myocardial t1/2 of the I-131 HA was observed only at a higher cumulative dose, 10 mg/kg. No significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with doxorubicin. Our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with I-131 HA are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity.",1,0,0,0

"Debrisoquine phenotype and the pharmacokinetics and beta-2 receptor pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and its enantiomers. The metabolism of the cardioselective beta-blocker metoprolol is under genetic control of the debrisoquine/sparteine type. The two metabolic phenotypes, extensive (EM) and poor metabolizers (PM), show different stereoselective metabolism, resulting in apparently higher beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonistic potency of racemic metoprolol in EMs. We investigated if the latter also applies to the beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonism by metoprolol. The drug effect studied was the antagonism by metoprolol of terbutaline-induced hypokalemia. By using pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic modeling the pharmacodynamics of racemic metoprolol and the active S-isomer, were quantitated in EMs and PMs in terms of IC50 values, representing metoprolol plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximum receptor occupancy. Six EMs received 0.5 mg of terbutaline s.c. on two different occasions: 1) 1 hr after administration of a placebo and 2) 1 hr after 150 mg of metoprolol p.o. Five PMs were studied according to the same protocol, except for a higher terbutaline dose (0.75 mg) on day 2. Blood samples for the analysis of plasma potassium, terbutaline, metoprolol (racemic, R- and S-isomer), and alpha-hydroxymetoprolol concentrations were taken at regular time intervals, during 8 hr after metoprolol. In PMs, metoprolol increased the terbutaline area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (+67%). Higher metoprolol/alpha-hydroxymetoprolol ratios in PMs were predictive for higher R-/S-isomer ratios of unchanged drug. There was a difference in metoprolol potency with higher racemic metoprolol IC50 values in PMs (72 +/- 7 ng.ml-1) than EMs (42 +/- 8 ng.ml-1, P less than .001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0,1,0

To facilitate the evaluation of ATM heterozygotes for susceptibility to other diseases , such as breast cancer , we have attempted to define the most common mutations and their frequencies in ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) homozygotes from 10 ethnic populations . Both genomic mutations and their effects on cDNA were characterized . Protein-truncation testing of the entire ATM cDNA detected 92 ( 66 % ) truncating mutations in 140 mutant alleles screened . The haplotyping of patients with identical mutations indicates that almost all of these represent common ancestry and that very few spontaneously recurring ATM mutations exist .

"Aconitine-induced Ca2+ overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats. Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants. Emerging evidence indicates that voltage-dependent Na(+) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine. However, no reports are available on the role of Ca(2+) in aconitine poisoning. In this study, we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2+) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo. We found that Ca(2+) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats. To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury, we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats. The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose-dependently. To confirm the pro-apoptotic effects, we performed flow cytometric detection, cardiac histology, transmission electron microscopy and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling assay. The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time-dependently. The expression analysis of Ca(2+) handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2+) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2+) handling proteins. The expression analysis of apoptosis-related proteins revealed that pro-apoptotic protein expression was upregulated, and anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 expression was downregulated. Furthermore, increased phosphorylation of MAPK family members, especially the P-P38/P38 ratio was found in cardiac tissues. Hence, our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2+) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.",1,0,1,0
"Prospective study of the long-term effects of somatostatin analog (octreotide) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in Chinese acromegalic patients. This article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 Chinese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300-1500 micrograms/day for a mean of 24.2 +/- 13.9 months. During treatment with octreotide, 17 patients developed sludge, 10 had gallstones, and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surgery. In all of 7 patients examined acutely, gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100-micrograms injection. In 8 patients followed for 24 weeks, gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therapy. After withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones, 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 month. In 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment, gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients (3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks), and remained depressed in 3 (2 of whom had stones present at 6 months). Our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge, gallstones, and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in Chinese acromegalic patients. It is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long-term octreotide therapy of acromegalic patients.",0,0,1,0
"cDNA microarrays detect activation of a myogenic transcription program by the PAX3-FKHR fusion oncogene. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle characterized in 60 % of cases by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) . This results in the fusion of PAX3 , a developmental transcription factor required for limb myogenesis , with FKHR , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . The resultant PAX3-FKHR gene possesses transforming properties ; however , the effects of this chimeric oncogene on gene expression are largely unknown . To investigate the actions of these transcription factors , both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells , and the resultant gene expression changes were analyzed with a murine cDNA microarray containing 2 , 225 elements . We found that PAX3-FKHR but not PAX3 activated a myogenic transcription program including the induction of transcription factors MyoD , Myogenin , Six1 , and Slug as well as a battery of genes involved in several aspects of muscle function . Notable among this group were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5 . Relevance of this model was suggested by verification that three of these genes ( IGFBP5 , HSIX1 , and Slug ) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines .

"Memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releaser PG-9. The effects of PG-9 (3alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate), the acetylcholine releaser, on memory processes and nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis were evaluated. In the mouse passive-avoidance test, PG-9 (10-30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered 20 min before the training session, prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antimuscarinic drug scopolamine and the M1-selective antagonist S-(-)-ET-126. In the same experimental conditions, PG-9 (5-20 microg per mouse, i.c.v.) was also able to prevent antimuscarine-induced amnesia, demonstrating a central localization of the activity. At the highest effective doses, PG-9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the Irwin test, and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity, as revealed by the hole-board test. PG-9 was also able to increase the amount of NGF secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal NGF contents obtained by PG-9 were 17.6-fold of the control value. During culture, no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of PG-9. The current work indicates the ability of PG-9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of NGF synthesis in astroglial cells. Therefore, PG-9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes.",0,0,1,0
"Omitting fentanyl reduces nausea and vomiting, without increasing pain, after sevoflurane for day surgery. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Despite advantages of induction and maintenance of anaesthesia with sevoflurane, postoperative nausea and vomiting occurs frequently. Fentanyl is a commonly used supplement that may contribute to this, although it may also improve analgesia. METHODS: This double-blind study examined the incidence and severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting and pain in the first 24 h after sevoflurane anaesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly allocated to either receive or not receive 1 1 fentanyl, while a third group received dexamethasone in addition to fentanyl. RESULTS: Omission of fentanyl did not reduce the overall incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but did reduce the incidence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% and 17% with fentanyl and fentanyl-dexamethasone, respectively, to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic requirements were reduced from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant effect on the incidence or severity of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Combining the two fentanyl groups revealed further significant benefits from the avoidance of opioids, reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while nausea in the first 24 h was decreased from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were unaffected by the omission of fentanyl. Fentanyl did reduce minor intraoperative movement but had no sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension and bradycardia. CONCLUSION: As fentanyl exacerbated postoperative nausea and vomiting without an improvement in postoperative pain and also had adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it appears to be an unnecessary and possibly detrimental supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.",1,0,0,0

"Somatic instability of the CTG repeat in mice transgenic for the myotonic dystrophy region is age dependent but not correlated to the relative intertissue transcription levels and proliferative capacities. A ( CTG ) nexpansion in the 3-untranslated region ( UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) is responsible for causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . Major instability , with very large expansions between generations and high levels of somatic mosaicism , is observed in patients . There is a good correlation between repeat size ( at least in leucocytes ) , clinical severity and age of onset . The trinucleotide repeat instability mechanisms involved in DM and other human genetic diseases are unknown . We studied somatic instability by measuring the CTG repeat length at several ages in various tissues of transgenic mice carrying a ( CTG ) 55expansion surrounded by 45 kb of the human DM region , using small-pool PCR . These mice have been shown to reproduce the intergenerational and somatic instability of the 55 CTG repeat suggesting that surrounding sequences and the chromatin environment are involved in instability mechanisms . As observed in some of the tissues of DM patients , there is a tendency for repeat length and somatic mosaicism to increase with the age of the mouse . Furthermore , we observed no correlation between the somatic mutation rate and tissue proliferation capacity . The somatic mutation rates in different tissues were also not correlated to the relative inter-tissue difference in transcriptional levels of the three genes ( DMAHP , DMPK and 59 ) surrounding the repeat . .",0,0,1,0

"Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients. AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, Ser311Cys, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, Ser311Cys and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the DRD2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between DRD2 and EPS in Caucasians.",0,0,1,0
Acute renal failure in patients with AIDS on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for osteomyelitis. Renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir disoproxil fumarate as part of an antiretroviral regimen. Tenofovir has been implicated in the development of Fanconi syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubule. Vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic agent. Clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin.,0,1,0,0

"Putative X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy gene shares unexpected homology with ABC transporters. Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is an X-linked disease affecting 1 / 20 , 000 males either as cerebral ALD in childhood or as adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) in adults . Childhood ALD is the more severe form , with onset of neurological symptoms between 5-12 years of age . Central nervous system demyelination progresses rapidly and death occurs within a few years . AMN is a milder form of the disease with onset at 15-30 years of age and a more progressive course . Adrenal insufficiency ( Addisons disease ) may remain the only clinical manifestation of ALD . The principal biochemical abnormality of ALD is the accumulation of very-long-chain fatty acids ( VLCFA ) because of impaired beta-oxidation in peroxisomes . The normal oxidation of VLCFA-CoA in patients fibroblasts suggested that the gene coding for the VLCFA-CoA synthetase could be a candidate gene for ALD . Here we use positional cloning to identify a gene partially deleted in 6 of 85 independent patients with ALD . In familial cases , the deletions segregated with the disease . An identical deletion was detected in two brothers presenting with different clinical ALD phenotypes . Candidate exons were identified by computer analysis of genomic sequences and used to isolate complementary DNAs by exon connection and screening of cDNA libraries . The deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity to a peroxisomal membrane protein of M ( r ) 70K that is involved in peroxisome biogenesis and belongs to the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of transporters . .",0,1,1,0
"Focal cerebral ischemia in rats: effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension during reperfusion. After 180 min of temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the effect of phenylephrine-induced hypertension on ischemic brain injury and blood-brain barrier permeability was determined. Blood pressure was manipulated by one of the following schedules during 120 min of reperfusion: Control, normotensive reperfusion; 90/hypertension (90/HTN), blood pressure was increased by 35 mm Hg during the initial 90 min of reperfusion only; 15/hypertension (15/HTN), normotensive reperfusion for 30 min followed by 15 min of hypertension and 75 min of normotension. Part A, for eight rats in each group brain injury was evaluated by staining tissue using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride and edema was evaluated by microgravimetry. Part B, for eight different rats in each group blood-brain barrier permeability was evaluated by measuring the amount and extent of extravasation of Evans Blue dye. Brain injury (percentage of the ischemic hemisphere) was less in the 15/HTN group (16 +/- 6, mean +/- SD) versus the 90/HTN group (30 +/- 6), which was in turn less than the control group (42 +/- 5). Specific gravity was greater in the 15/HTN group (1.043 +/- 0.002) versus the 90/HTN (1.036 +/- 0.003) and control (1.037 +/- 0.003) groups. Evans Blue (mug g-1 of brain tissue) was greater in the 90/HTN group (24.4 +/- 6.0) versus the control group (12.3 +/- 4.1), which was in turn greater than the 15/HTN group (7.3 +/- 3.2). This study supports a hypothesis that during reperfusion, a short interval of hypertension decreases brain injury and edema; and that sustained hypertension increases the risk of vasogenic edema.",1,0,1,0

"Canavan disease: genomic organization and localization of human ASPA to 17p13-ter and conservation of the ASPA gene during evolution. Canavan disease , or spongy degeneration of the brain , is a severe leukodystrophy caused by the deficiency of aspartoacylase ( ASPA ) . Recently , a missense mutation was identified in human ASPA coding sequence from patients with Canavan disease . The human ASPA gene has been cloned and found to span 29 kb of the genome . Human aspartoacylase is coded by six exons intervened by five introns . The exons vary from 94 ( exon III ) to 514 ( exon VI ) bases . The exon / intron splice junction sites follow the gt / ag consensus sequence rule . Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from human / mouse somatic cell hybrid cell lines localized ASPA to human chromosome 17 . The human ASPA locus was further mapped in the 17p13-ter region by fluorescence in situ hybridization . The bovine aspa gene has also been cloned , and its exon / intron organization is identical to that of the human gene . The 500-base sequence upstream of the initiator ATG codon in the human gene and that in the bovine gene are 77 % identical . Human ASPA coding sequences cross-hybridize with genomic DNA from yeast , chicken , rabbit , cow , dog , mouse , rat , and monkey . The specificity of cross-species hybridization of coding sequences suggests that aspartoacylase has been conserved during evolution . It should now be possible to identify mutations in the noncoding genomic sequences that lead to Canavan disease and to study the regulation of ASPA . .",0,0,1,0

"Fatal carbamazepine induced fulminant eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis: emphasis on anatomical and histological characteristics, mechanisms and genetics of drug hypersensitivity and differential diagnosis. The most severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine have been observed in the haemopoietic system, the liver and the cardiovascular system. A frequently fatal, although exceptionally rare side effect of carbamazepine is necrotizing eosinophilic (hypersensitivity) myocarditis. We report a case of hypersensitivity myocarditis secondary to administration of carbamazepine. Acute hypersensitivity myocarditis was not suspected clinically, and the diagnosis was made post-mortem. Histology revealed diffuse infiltration of the myocardium by eosinophils and lymphocytes with myocyte damage. Clinically, death was due to cardiogenic shock. To best of our knowledge this is the second case of fatal carbamazepine induced myocarditis reported in English literature.",1,1,1,0
"Evaluation of cardiac troponin I and T levels as markers of myocardial damage in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy rats, and their relationship with echocardiographic and histological findings. BACKGROUND: Cardiac troponins I (cTnI) and T (cTnT) have been shown to be highly sensitive and specific markers of myocardial cell injury. We investigated the diagnostic value of cTnI and cTnT for the diagnosis of myocardial damage in a rat model of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, and we examined the relationship between serial cTnI and cTnT with the development of cardiac disorders monitored by echocardiography and histological examinations in this model. METHODS: Thirty-five Wistar rats were given 1.5 mg/kg DOX, i.v., weekly for up to 8 weeks for a total cumulative dose of 12 mg/kg BW. Ten rats received saline as a control group. cTnI was measured with Access(R) (ng/ml) and a research immunoassay (pg/ml), and compared with cTnT, CK-MB mass and CK. By using transthoracic echocardiography, anterior and posterior wall thickness, LV diameters and LV fractional shortening (FS) were measured in all rats before DOX or saline, and at weeks 6 and 9 after treatment in all surviving rats. Histology was performed in DOX-rats at 6 and 9 weeks after the last DOX dose and in all controls. RESULTS: Eighteen of the DOX rats died prematurely of general toxicity during the 9-week period. End-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) LV diameters/BW significantly increased, whereas LV FS was decreased after 9 weeks in the DOX group (p<0.001). These parameters remained unchanged in controls. Histological evaluation of hearts from all rats given DOX revealed significant slight degrees of perivascular and interstitial fibrosis. In 7 of the 18 rats, degeneration and myocyte vacuolisation were found. Only five of the controls exhibited evidence of very slight perivascular fibrosis. A significant rise in cTnT was found in DOX rats after cumulative doses of 7.5 and 12 mg/kg in comparison with baseline (p<0.05). cTnT found in rats after 12 mg/kg were significantly greater than that found after 7.5 mg/kg DOX. Maximal cTnI (pg/ml) and cTnT levels were significantly increased in DOX rats compared with controls (p=0.006, 0.007). cTnI (ng/ml), CK-MB mass and CK remained unchanged in DOX rats compared with controls. All markers remained stable in controls. Analysis of data revealed a significant correlation between maximal cTnT and ED and ES LV diameters/BW (r=0.81 and 0.65; p<0.0001). A significant relationship was observed between maximal cTnT and the extent of myocardial morphological changes, and between LV diameters/BW and histological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Among markers of ischemic injury after DOX in rats, cTnT showed the greatest ability to detect myocardial damage assessed by echocardiographic detection and histological changes. Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX, probably due to heterogeneity in cross-reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms, it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments.",1,0,1,0

A PubMed Central and EMBASE search was conducted up to July 2007. The reference lists of identified papers were examined for further trials. Of 425 studies identified, 20 were included in the meta-analysis (840 patients).

"Acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rats. Reserpine- and haloperidol-induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia (TD) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress. In the present study, the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rats. Reserpine injection (one dose of 1 mg/kg s.c.) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching, compared to the control. Haloperidol administration (one dose of 12 mg/kg once a week s.c.) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacuous chewing, tongue protrusion and duration of facial twitching observed in four weekly evaluations. After the treatments and behavioral observation, glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analyzed. A decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol, compared to the control. Importantly, a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial diskinesia. These results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacuous chewing movements in rats.",0,0,1,0

"Cauda equina syndrome after epidural steroid injection: a case report. OBJECTIVE: Conventional treatment methods of lumbusacral radiculopathy are physical therapy, epidural steroid injections, oral medications, and spinal manipulative therapy. Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesia. The following case is a report of cauda equina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bupivacaine. CLINICAL FEATURES: A 50-year-old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injection. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: An 18-gauge Touhy needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the L4-5 level. Spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imaging. After verifying the epidural space, bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injected. After the injection, there was a reduction in radicular symptoms. Three hours later, she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity weakness. The neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the saddle area and medial aspect of her right leg. There was a decrease in the perception of pinprick test. Deep-tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right leg. She was unable to urinate. The patient's symptoms improved slightly over the next few hours.

"Sorafenib-induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spasm. A 65-year-old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest. Two weeks before his admission, sorafenib had been started. He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardiogram. Enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed subendocardial infarction. However, there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angiography. Coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test. Cessation of sorafenib and administration of Ca-channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms, but relapse occurred after resumption of sorafenib. Addition of oral nicorandil reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina status. We report the first case of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survival. On the other hand, the Rho/ROCK pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. Our report may show an adverse effect on the Rho/ROCK pathway by sorafenib use.",1,1,1,1

"Attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride in rats. The effect of amiloride on lithium-induced polydipsia and polyuria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats, chronically treated with LiCl. Amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute (6 or 12 h) and a subacute (3 days) experiment. 6 h after the administration of amiloride, a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studied. At 12 h, all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium levels. After 3 days of combined treatment, a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water intake. In all the experiments, the attenuation of the lithium-induced diabetes-insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium level. It is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium-treated patients suffering from polydipsia and polyuria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous.",0,1,1,0

"Increase in intragastric pressure during suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations in children: inhibition by alfentanil. Changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of suxamethonium 1.5 mg kg-1 i.v. were studied in 32 children (mean age 6.9 yr) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1. Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone 5 mg kg-1. The incidence and intensity of muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil group. The intragastric pressure during muscle fasciculations was significantly higher in the control group (16 +/- 0.7 (SEM) cm H2O) than in the alfentanil group (7.7 +/- 1.5 (SEM) cm H2O). The increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fasciculations (regression line: y = 0.5 + 4.78x with r of 0.78). It is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fasciculations caused by suxamethonium in healthy children. Alfentanil 50 micrograms kg-1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations; moreover, intragastric pressure remains at its control value.",0,0,1,0
"Worsening of levodopa-induced dyskinesias by motor and mental tasks. Ten patients who had Parkinson's disease with disabling dyskinesia were included in this study to evaluate the role of mental (mental calculation) and motor (flexion/extension of right fingers, flexion/extension of left fingers, flexion/extension of the neck, speaking aloud) tasks on the worsening of peak-dose dyskinesia following administration of an effective single dose of apomorphine. Compared with the score at rest (1.3+/-0.3), a significant aggravation of the dyskinesia score was observed during speaking aloud (5.2+/-1.1, p<0.05), movements of right (4.5+/-1.0, p<0.05) and left (3.7+/-0.8, p<0.05) fingers, movements of the neck (5.1+/-1.0, p<0.05), and mental calculation (3.1+/-1.0, p<0.05).

"Haplotype and multipoint linkage analysis in Finnish choroideremia families. Multipoint linkage analysis of choroideremia ( TCD ) and seven X chromosomal restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) was carried out in 18 Finnish TCD families . The data place TCD distal to PGK and DXS72 , very close to DXYS1 and DXYS5 ( Zmax = 24 at theta = 0 ) and proximal to DXYS4 and DXYS12 . This agrees with the data obtained from other linkage studies and from physical mapping . All the TCD males and carrier females studied have the same DXYS1 allele in coupling with TCD . In Northeastern Finland , 66 / 69 chromosomes carrying TCD had the same haplotype at loci DXS72 , DXYS1 , DXYS4 , and DXYS12 . The same haplotype is seen in only 15 / 99 chromosomes not carrying TCD . Moreover , in 71 / 104 non-TCD chromosomes , the haplotype at six marker loci is different from those seen in any of the 76 TCD chromosomes . This supports the previously described hypothesis that the large Northern Finnish choroideremia pedigrees , comprising a total of over 80 living patients representing more than a fifth of all TCD patients described worldwide , carry the same mutation . These linkage and haplotype data provide improved opportunities for prenatal diagnosis based on RFLP studies . .",0,0,1,0

"Flestolol: an ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Flestolol (ACC-9089) is a nonselective, competitive, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent, without any intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Flestolol is metabolized by plasma esterases and has an elimination half-life of approximately 6.5 minutes. This agent was well tolerated in healthy volunteers at doses up to 100 micrograms/kg/min. In long-term infusion studies, flestolol was well tolerated at the effective beta-blocking dose (5 micrograms/kg/min) for up to seven days. Flestolol blood concentrations increased linearly with increasing dose and good correlation exists between blood concentrations of flestolol and beta-adrenergic blockade. Flestolol produced a dose-dependent attenuation of isoproterenol-induced tachycardia. Electrophysiologic and hemodynamic effects of flestolol are similar to those of other beta blockers. In contrast with other beta blockers, flestolol-induced effects reverse rapidly (within 30 minutes) following discontinuation because of its short half-life. Flestolol effectively reduced heart rate in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmia. In patients with unstable angina, flestolol infusion was found to be safe and effective in controlling chest pain. It is concluded that flestolol is a potent, well-tolerated, ultra-short-acting beta-adrenergic blocking agent. Use of flestolol in the critical care setting is currently undergoing investigation.",1,0,1,0
"In vitro characterization of parasympathetic and sympathetic responses in cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat. In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in the rat, detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered. Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine reduced contractions, but in contrast to controls, it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations. In both types, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective') and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited the tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was decreased and the pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was much less efficient than in controls. In contrast to controls, methoctramine increased -- instead of decreased -- the tonic responses at high frequencies. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were the same in inflamed and in control strips when related to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Thus, in cystitis substantial changes of the efferent functional responses occur. While postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, effects by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be increased.",0,1,1,0

"Conversion to rapamycin immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients: report of an initial experience. BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of RAPA conversion in patients undergoing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. METHODS: Twenty renal transplant recipients were switched to fixed dose rapamycin (RAPA) (5 mg/day) 0 to 204 months posttransplant. Drug monitoring was not initially used to adjust doses. The indications for switch were chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity in 1. Follow-up is 7 to 24 months. RESULTS: In the 12 patients switched because of chronic nephrotoxicity there was a significant decrease in serum creatinine [233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months]. Facial dysmorphism improved in two patients. No relapse of PTLD was observed. Five patients developed pneumonia (two Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, one infectious mononucleosis with polyclonal PTLD lung infiltrate) and two had bronchiolitis obliterans. There were no deaths. RAPA was discontinued in four patients, because of pneumonia in two, PTLD in one, and oral aphtous ulcers in one. RAPA levels were high (>15 ng/ml) in 7 of 13 (54%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: RAPA conversion provides adequate immunosuppression to enable CsA withdrawal. However, when converting patients to RAPA drug levels should be monitored to avoid over-immunosuppression and adequate antiviral and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia prophylaxis should be given.",0,1,0,0

"Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir. Many patients, however, develop negative long-term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis. We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir-treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation. In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir. We have utilized the human monocyte cell line, THP-1 as a model to address this question. Briefly, cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage-like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta-estradiol (E2), 100 nM progesterone or vehicle (0.01% ethanol). Cells were then treated with 30 ng/ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested, and lipid or total RNA was isolated. E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment. Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor, CD36 mRNA, responsible for the uptake of LDL. Additionally, ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA, a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression. Treatment with E2, however, failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level. E2 did, however, significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry. This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte-derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment.",0,0,1,0

"Ocular motility changes after subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy for retinoblastoma. BACKGROUND: Focal subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. OBJECTIVE: To report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. METHODS: We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing, comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diagnosis. Eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure (n = 4) were examined histologically. RESULTS: Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of multimodality therapy. Histopathological examination revealed many lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye, indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis. The enucleations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. CONCLUSIONS: Subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficult. Subtenon carboplatin is not free of toxicity, and its use is best restricted to specific indications.",0,0,0,1
"Proteomic analysis of striatal proteins in the rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID) is among the motor complications that arise in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients after a prolonged treatment with L-DOPA. To this day, transcriptome analysis has been performed in a rat model of LID [Neurobiol. Dis., 17 (2004), 219] but information regarding the proteome is still lacking. In the present study, we investigated the changes occurring at the protein level in striatal samples obtained from the unilaterally 6-hydroxydopamine-lesion rat model of PD treated with saline, L-DOPA or bromocriptine using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry (MS). Rats treated with L-DOPA were allocated to two groups based on the presence or absence of LID. Among the 2000 spots compared for statistical difference, 67 spots were significantly changed in abundance and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS, atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization and HPLC coupled tandem MS (LC/MS/MS). Out of these 67 proteins, LID significantly changed the expression level of five proteins: alphabeta-crystalin, gamma-enolase, guanidoacetate methyltransferase, vinculin, and proteasome alpha-2 subunit. Complementary techniques such as western immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to investigate the validity of the data obtained using the proteomic approach. In conclusion, this study provides new insights into the protein changes occurring in LID.",0,0,1,0

"A selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist, NRA0160: a preclinical neuropharmacological profile. NRA0160, 5 - [2- ( 4- ( 3 - fluorobenzylidene) piperidin-1-yl) ethyl] - 4 -(4-fluorophenyl) thiazole-2-carboxamide, has a high affinity for human cloned dopamine D4.2, D4.4 and D4.7 receptors, with Ki values of 0.5, 0.9 and 2.7 nM, respectively. NRA0160 is over 20,000fold more potent at the dopamine D4.2 receptor compared with the human cloned dopamine D2L receptor. NRA0160 has negligible affinity for the human cloned dopamine D3 receptor (Ki=39 nM), rat serotonin (5-HT)2A receptors (Ki=180 nM) and rat alpha1 adrenoceptor (Ki=237 nM). NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized locomotor hyperactivity induced by methamphetamine (MAP) in mice. NRA0160 and clozapine antagonized MAP-induced stereotyped behavior in mice, although their effects did not exceed 50% inhibition, even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly induced catalepsy in rats, although their effects did not exceed 50% induction even at the highest dose given. NRA0160 and clozapine significantly reversed the disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in rats produced by apomorphine.

"Anti-carcinogenic action of phenobarbital given simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine in the rat. The present work has been planned in order to elucidate the effect of phenobarbital (PB: 15 mg per rat of ingested dose) on carcinogenesis when it is administered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN: 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were treated by DEN alone or by DEN + PB during 2, 4 and 6 weeks according to our schedule for hepatocarcinogenesis. After the end of the treatment, the number and the size of induced PAS positive preneoplastic foci was significantly reduced when PB was given simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei normally observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN treated rats were also significantly decreased in DEN + PB treated rats. When the treatment last only 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not change significantly the last parameters. In DEN + PB treated rats, the survival was prolonged and the tumor incidence decreased as compared with the results obtained by DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which promotes carcinogenesis when administered after the DEN treatment, reduces the carcinogen effect when given simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' effect acts on the initiation as well as on the promotion of the precancerous lesions. Biochemical investigations are in progress to obtain more information about this 'paradoxical' PB effect.",0,0,0,1

"The Pendred syndrome gene encodes a chloride-iodide transport protein. Pendred syndrome is the most common form of syndromic deafness and characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss and goitre . This disorder was mapped to chromosome 7 and the gene causing Pendred syndrome ( PDS ) was subsequently identified by positional cloning . PDS encodes a putative transmembrane protein designated pendrin . Pendrin is closely related to a family of sulfate transport proteins that includes the rat sulfate-anion transporter ( encoded by Sat-1 ; 29 % amino acid sequence identity ) , the human diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter ( encoded by DTD ; 32 % ) and the human sulfate transporter downregulated in adenoma ( encoded by DRA ; 45 % ) . On the basis of this homology and the presence of a slightly modified sulfate-transporter signature sequence comprising its putative second transmembrane domain , pendrin has been proposed to function as a sulfate transporter . We were unable to detect evidence of sulfate transport following the expression of pendrin in Xenopus laevis oocytes by microinjection of PDS cRNA or in Sf9 cells following infection with PDS-recombinant baculovirus . The rates of transport for iodide and chloride were significantly increased following the expression of pendrin in both cell systems .

"Effects of the novel compound aniracetam (Ro 13-5057) upon impaired learning and memory in rodents. The effect of aniracetam (Ro 13-5057, 1-anisoyl-2-pyrrolidinone) was studied on various forms of experimentally impaired cognitive functions (learning and memory) in rodents and produced the following effects: (1) almost complete prevention of the incapacity to learn a discrete escape response in rats exposed to sublethal hypercapnia immediately before the acquisition session; (2) partial (rats) or complete (mice) prevention of the scopolamine-induced short-term amnesia for a passive avoidance task; (3) complete protection against amnesia for a passive avoidance task in rats submitted to electroconvulsive shock immediately after avoidance acquisition; (4) prevention of the long-term retention- or retrieval-deficit for a passive avoidance task induced in rats and mice by chloramphenicol or cycloheximide administered immediately after acquisition; (5) reversal, when administered as late as 1 h before the retention test, of the deficit in retention or retrieval of a passive avoidance task induced by cycloheximide injected 2 days previously; (6) prevention of the deficit in the retrieval of an active avoidance task induced in mice by subconvulsant electroshock or hypercapnia applied immediately before retrieval testing (24 h after acquisition). These improvements or normalizations of impaired cognitive functions were seen at oral aniracetam doses of 10-100 mg/kg. Generally, the dose-response curves were bell-shaped. The mechanisms underlying the activity of aniracetam and its 'therapeutic window' are unknown. Piracetam, another pyrrolidinone derivative was used for comparison. It was active only in six of nine tests and had about one-tenth the potency of aniracetam. The results indicate that aniracetam improves cognitive functions which are impaired by different procedure and in different phases of the learning and memory process.",0,0,1,0
"Protective efficacy of neuroactive steroids against cocaine kindled-seizures in mice. Neuroactive steroids demonstrate pharmacological actions that have relevance for a host of neurological and psychiatric disorders. They offer protection against seizures in a range of models and seem to inhibit certain stages of drug dependence in preclinical assessments. The present study was designed to evaluate two endogenous and one synthetic neuroactive steroid that positively modulate the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor against the increase in sensitivity to the convulsant effects of cocaine engendered by repeated cocaine administration (seizure kindling). Allopregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5alpha-pregnan-20-one), pregnanolone (3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-pregnan-20-one) and ganaxolone (a synthetic derivative of allopregnanolone 3alpha-hydroxy-3beta-methyl-5alpha-pregnan-20-one) were tested for their ability to suppress the expression (anticonvulsant effect) and development (antiepileptogenic effect) of cocaine-kindled seizures in male, Swiss-Webster mice. Kindled seizures were induced by daily administration of 60 mg/kg cocaine for 5 days. All of these positive GABA(A) modulators suppressed the expression of kindled seizures, whereas only allopregnanolone and ganaxolone inhibited the development of kindling. Allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, but not ganaxolone, also reduced cumulative lethality associated with kindling. These findings demonstrate that some neuroactive steroids attenuate convulsant and sensitizing properties of cocaine and add to a growing literature on their potential use in the modulation of effects of drugs of abuse.",0,0,1,0

"Effects of dehydroepiandrosterone in amphetamine-induced schizophrenia models in mice. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on animal models of schizophrenia. METHODS: Seventy Swiss albino female mice (25-35 g) were divided into 4 groups: amphetamine-free (control), amphetamine, 50, and 100 mg/kg DHEA. The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally (ip) for 5 days. Amphetamine (3 mg/kg ip) induced hyper locomotion, apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg subcutaneously [sc]) induced climbing, and haloperidol (1.5 mg/kg sc) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia. The study was conducted at the Animal Experiment Laboratories, Department of Pharmacology, Medical School, Eskisehir Osmangazi University, Eskisehir, Turkey between March and May 2012. Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis test for hyper locomotion, and one-way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests. RESULTS: In the amphetamine-induced locomotion test, there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine-free group. Both DHEA 50 mg/kg (p<0.05), and 100 mg/kg (p<0.01) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine-induced locomotion group. There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol-induced catalepsy test (p<0.05). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine-induced climbing test (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses, while it had no effect on climbing behavior. We suggest that DHEA displays typical neuroleptic-like effects, and may be used in the treatment of schizophrenia.",0,0,1,0

"Hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma, reduction in bile flow rate, and neutrophil sequestration within the liver. The pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in vivo. Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glutathione. There was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reperfusion. There was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injury. An increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. The lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membranes. These data also suggest that the measurement of tissue GSSG may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation.",0,1,0,0
"De novo deletions of SNRPN exon 1 in early human and mouse embryos result in a paternal to maternal imprint switch. Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is a neurogenetic disease characterized by infantile hypotonia , gonadal hypoplasia , obsessive behaviour and neonatal feeding difficulties followed by hyperphagia , leading to profound obesity . PWS is due to a lack of paternal genetic information at 15q11-q13 ( ref . 2 ) . Five imprinted , paternally expressed genes map to the PWS region , MKRN3 ( ref . 3 ) , NDN ( ref . 4 ) , NDNL1 ( ref . 5 ) , SNRPN ( refs 6-8 ) and IPW ( ref . 9 ) , as well as two poorly characterized framents designated PAR-1 and PAR-5 ( ref . 10 ) . Imprinting of this region involves a bipartite imprinting centre ( IC ) , which overlaps SNRPN ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Deletion of the SNRPN promoter / exon 1 region ( the PWS IC element ) appears to impair the establishment of the paternal imprint in the male germ line and leads to PWS . Here we report a PWS family in which the father is mosaic for an IC deletion on his paternal chromosome . The deletion chromosome has acquired a maternal methylation imprint in his somatic cells . We have made identical findings in chimaeric mice generated from two independent embryonic stem ( ES ) cell lines harbouring a similar deletion . Our studies demonstrate that the PWS IC element is not only required for the establishment of the paternal imprint , but also for its postzygotic maintenance . .",0,0,1,0
"Reversal of ammonia coma in rats by L-dopa: a peripheral effect. Ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraperitonealinjection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL. This coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol L-dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection. The effect of L-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and urea. Intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentrations. Bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not prevented. Thus, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after L-dopa, can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action. These results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephalopathic patients receiving L-dopa.",0,1,1,0
"5-azacytidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat liver. To test the validity of the hypothesis that hypomethylation of DNA plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens, benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg) and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). The initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci formed following a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for example 10-20 foci/cm2 in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen only. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2-DMH further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, indicating that incorporation of 5-AzC occurs during repair synthesis. In the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation should be maximum, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. The results suggest that hypomethylation of DNA per se may not be sufficient for initiation. Perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation, the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hypomethylation of DNA.",0,1,0,0

"Evaluation of adverse reactions of aponidine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution. We prospectively evaluated the adverse reactions of apraclonidine in 20 normal volunteers by instilling a single drop of 1% apraclonidine in their right eyes. Examinations, including blood pressure, pulse rate, conjunctiva and cornea, intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil diameter, basal tear secretion and margin reflex distance of both upper and lower eyelids, were performed prior to entry and at 1, 3, 5 and 7 hours after instillation. The ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant for apraclonidine-treated eyes throughout the study and also statistically significant for contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% apraclonidine. Decreases in systolic blood pressure were statistically, but not clinically, significant. No significant changes in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate and basal tear secretion were noted. Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were commonly found. Upper lid retraction was frequently noted. While the elevations of the upper lid margin in most subjects were not more than 2 mm and did not cause noticeable change in appearance, one subject suffered from mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after instillation of the medication. This may well be a particularly notable finding in Asian people.",1,0,0,0
"Characteristics of intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in myotonic dystrophy. In myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the size of a CTG repeat in the DM kinase gene generally increases in successive generations with clinical evidence of anticipation . However , there have also been cases with an intergenerational contraction of the repeat . We examined 1 , 489 DM parent-offspring pairs , of which 95 ( 6 . 4 % ) showed such contractions in peripheral blood leukocytes ( PBL ) . In 56 of the 95 pairs , clinical data allowed an analysis of their anticipation status . It is surprising that anticipation occurred in 27 ( 48 % ) of these 56 pairs , while none clearly showed a later onset of DM in the symptomatic offspring . The contraction occurred in 76 ( 10 % ) of 753 paternal transmissions and in 19 ( 3 % ) of 736 maternal transmissions . Anticipation was observed more frequently in maternal ( 85 % ) than in paternal ( 37 % ) transmissions ( P DM parents had multiple DM offspring with the CTG repeat contractions . This frequency was higher than the frequency expected from the probability of the repeat contractions ( 6 . 4 % ) and the size of DM sib population ( 1 . 54 DM offspring per DM parent , in 968 DM parents ) . We conclude that ( 1 ) intergenerational contractions of the CTG repeat in leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation , especially when DM is maternally transmitted , and ( 2 ) the paternal origin of the repeat and the presence of the repeat contraction in a sibling increase the probability of the CTG repeat contraction",0,0,1,0
"MR imaging with quantitative diffusion mapping of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity in organ transplant patients. Our objective was to investigate brain MR imaging findings and the utility of diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging in organ transplant patients who developed neurologic symptoms during tacrolimus therapy. Brain MR studies, including DW imaging, were prospectively performed in 14 organ transplant patients receiving tacrolimus who developed neurologic complications. In each patient who had abnormalities on the initial MR study, a follow-up MR study was performed 1 month later. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values on the initial MR study were correlated with reversibility of the lesions. Of the 14 patients, 5 (35.7%) had white matter abnormalities, 1 (7.1%) had putaminal hemorrhage, and 8 (57.1%) had normal findings on initial MR images. Among the 5 patients with white matter abnormalities, 4 patients (80.0%) showed higher than normal ADC values on initial MR images, and all showed complete resolution on follow-up images. The remaining 1 patient (20.0%) showed lower than normal ADC value and showed incomplete resolution with cortical laminar necrosis. Diffusion-weighted imaging may be useful in predicting the outcomes of the lesions of tacrolimus-induced neurotoxicity.",0,0,1,0

Morphine-induced seizures in newborn infants. Two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post-operative analgesia. They received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms/kg/hr and 40 micrograms/kg/hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6-24 micrograms/kg/hr and had no seizures. Plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive (60 and 90 mg/ml). Other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not reoccur in the subsequent 8 months. It is suggested that post-operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms/kg/ml in neonates.,0,0,1,0

"Receptor mechanisms of nicotine-induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine-treated rats. Rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine (1.5 mg/kg per day) by subcutaneously implanting each animal with an Alzet osmotic mini-pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1, 5 and 14 days. At the end of each pretreatment period, animals were used for (i) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) and (ii) measuring the density of L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding sites in the striatum. We observed no changes in nicotine-induced locomotor response, striatal L-[3H]nicotine and [3H]spiperone binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day. In rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days, there was a significant increase in the nicotine-stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine (DA) level in the striatum. The number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites was not affected. In animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days, the nicotine-induced locomotor response remained to be potentiated. However, this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal [3H]spiperone binding sites, whereas the number of striatal L-[3H]nicotine binding sites and the striatal DA level were normal. These results suggest that chronic nicotine-treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and DA concentration, followed by inducing DA receptor supersensitivity in the striatum.",0,0,1,0

"Constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma. In most patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , tumor development is initiated by somatic inactivation of both alleles of the RB1 gene . However , some of these patients can transmit retinoblastoma predisposition to their offspring . To determine the frequency and nature of constitutional RB1-gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma , we analyzed DNA from peripheral blood and from tumor tissue . The analysis of tumors from 54 ( 71 % ) of 76 informative patients showed loss of constitutional heterozygosity ( LOH ) at intragenic loci . Three of 13 uninformative patients had constitutional deletions . For 39 randomly selected tumors , SSCP , hetero-duplex analysis , sequencing , and Southern blot analysis were used to identify mutations . Mutations were detected in 21 ( 91 % ) of 23 tumors with LOH . In 6 ( 38 % ) of 16 tumors without LOH , one mutation was detected , and in 9 ( 56 % ) of the tumors without LOH , both mutations were found . Thus , a total of 45 mutations were identified in tumors of 36 patients . Thirty-nine of the mutations-including 34 small mutations , 2 large structural alterations , and hypermethylation in 3 tumors-were not detected in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA . In 6 ( 17 % ) of the 36 patients , a mutation was detected in constitutional DNA , and 1 of these mutations is known to be associated with reduced expressivity . The presence of a constitutional mutation was not associated with an early age at treatment . In 1 patient , somatic mosaicism was demonstrated by molecular analysis of DNA and RNA from peripheral blood . In 2 patients without a detectable mutation in peripheral blood , mosaicism was suggested because 1 of the patients showed multifocal tumors and the other later developed bilateral retinoblastoma . In conclusion , our results emphasize that the manifestation and transmissibility of retinoblastoma depend on the nature of the first mutation , its time in development , and the number and types of cells that are affected . .",0,0,0,1
"Predominance of the adrenomyeloneuropathy phenotype of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in The Netherlands: a survey of 30 kindreds. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X-ALD ) is an inherited disorder of peroxisomal beta-oxidation associated with accumulation of saturated very long-chain fatty acids , which results in central and peripheral demyelination and in impaired function of adrenal cortex and testes . The phenotypic expression is highly variable , childhood cerebral ALD ( CCALD ) and adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) being the main variants . We explored the 30 Dutch kindreds well known to the Dutch X-ALD / AMN Study Group and phenotyped 77 male patients  35 ( 46 % ) had AMN and 24 ( 31 % ) CCALD or adolescent cerebral ALD ( AdolCALD ) .

"Safety of capecitabine: a review. IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: Fluoropyrimidines, in particular 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), have been the mainstay of treatment for several solid tumors, including colorectal, breast and head and neck cancers, for > 40 years. AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: This article reviews the pharmacology and efficacy of capecitabine with a special emphasis on its safety. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will gain better insight into the safety of capecitabine in special populations such as patients with advanced age, renal and kidney disease. We also explore different dosing and schedules of capecitabine administration. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU and was developed to fulfill the need for a more convenient therapy and provide an improved safety/efficacy profile. It has shown promising results alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents in colorectal, breast, pancreaticobiliary, gastric, renal cell and head and neck cancers. The most commonly reported toxic effects of capecitabine are diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, stomatitis and hand-foot syndrome.

"The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma PAX3/FKHR fusion protein is a transcriptional activator. Chimeric transcription factors , created by gene fusions as the result of chromosomal translocations , have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several pathologically disparate solid tumors . The PAX3 / FKHR fusion gene , formed by a t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , encodes a hybrid protein that contains both PAX3 DNA binding domains , the paired box and homeodomain , linked to the bisected DNA binding domain of FKHR , a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors . Here we report that PAX3 and PAX3 / FKHR display similar , but not identical transactivation activities when tested with model Pax recognition sequences . No functional role could be ascribed solely to the residual FKHR binding domain present in the fusion protein , but FKHR was found to contribute a strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing the one located in the unrearranged PAX3 gene . We show that the native PAX3 / FKHR protein present in tumor cells with this translocation has transcriptional characteristics similar to the in vitro expressed protein . The ability of the PAX3 / FKHR hybrid protein to bind DNA in a sequence specific manner and to transactivate the expression of artificial reporter genes suggests that its aberrant expression could subvert the transcriptional programs that normally control the growth , differentiation , and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo . .",0,0,1,1

"Direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated pacemaker channels by clonidine. BACKGROUND: Inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease, including arrhythmia, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. Activation of presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the antisympathetic drug clonidine; however, other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clonidine. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm. Clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. As a consequence of blocking I(f), clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene-targeted mice in vivo, and thus, clonidine-like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.",1,0,0,0

"The role of p-aminophenol in acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on acetaminophen and p-aminophenol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats. Acetaminophen (APAP) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recently, p-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Therefore, the effect of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Rather, BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non-deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the BNPP-induced reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that PAP formation, in vivo, accounts, at least in part, for APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.",0,1,0,0
"A Phase II trial of cisplatin plus WR-2721 (amifostine) for metastatic breast carcinoma: an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Study (E8188). BACKGROUND: Cisplatin has minimal antitumor activity when used as second- or third-line treatment of metastatic breast carcinoma. Older reports suggest an objective response rate of 8% when 60-120 mg/m2 of cisplatin is administered every 3-4 weeks. Although a dose-response effect has been observed with cisplatin, the dose-limiting toxicities associated with cisplatin (e.g., nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neurotoxicity) have limited its use as a treatment for breast carcinoma. WR-2721 or amifostine initially was developed to protect military personnel in the event of nuclear war. Amifostine subsequently was shown to protect normal tissues from the toxic effects of alkylating agents and cisplatin without decreasing the antitumor effect of the chemotherapy. Early trials of cisplatin and amifostine also suggested that the incidence and severity of cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity, and neuropathy were reduced. METHODS: A Phase II study of the combination of cisplatin plus amifostine was conducted in patients with progressive metastatic breast carcinoma who had received one, but not more than one, chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease. Patients received amifostine, 910 mg/m2 intravenously over 15 minutes. After completion of the amifostine infusion, cisplatin 120 mg/m2 was administered over 30 minutes. Intravenous hydration and mannitol was administered before and after cisplatin. Treatment was administered every 3 weeks until disease progression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were enrolled in the study of which 7 (16%) were ineligible. A median of 2 cycles of therapy was administered to the 37 eligible patients. Six partial responses were observed for an overall response rate of 16%. Most patients (57%) stopped treatment because of disease progression. Neurologic toxicity was reported in 52% of patients. Seven different life-threatening toxicities were observed in patients while receiving treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of cisplatin and amifostine in this study resulted in an overall response rate of 16%. Neither a tumor-protective effect nor reduced toxicity to normal tissues was observed with the addition of amifostine to cisplatin in this trial.",0,1,1,1

"Corneal ulcers associated with aerosolized crack cocaine use. PURPOSE: We report 4 cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse. The pathogenesis of these ulcers and management of these patients are also reviewed. METHODS: Review of all cases of corneal ulcers associated with drug abuse seen at our institution from July 2006 to December 2006. RESULTS: Four patients with corneal ulcers associated with crack cocaine use were reviewed. All corneal ulcers were cultured, and the patients were admitted to the hospital for intensive topical antibiotic treatment. Each patient received comprehensive health care, including medical and substance abuse consultations. Streptococcal organisms were found in 3 cases and Capnocytophaga and Brevibacterium casei in 1 patient. The infections responded to antibiotic treatment. Two patients needed a lateral tarsorrhaphy for persistent epithelial defects. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized crack cocaine use can be associated with the development of corneal ulcers. Drug abuse provides additional challenges for management. Not only treatment of their infections but also the overall poor health of the patients and increased risk of noncompliance need to be addressed.

"Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure secondary to concomitant use of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of a severe interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir resulting in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. BACKGROUND: A 72-year-old white man with underlying human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine for 3 days. The patient was taking 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone at a dose of 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (initiated 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years previously). Laboratory evaluation revealed 66,680 U/L creatine kinase, 93 mg/dL blood urea nitrogen, 4.6 mg/dL creatinine, 1579 U/L aspartate aminotransferase, and 738 U/L alanine aminotransferase. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications were all temporarily discontinued and the patient was given forced alkaline diuresis and started on dialysis. Nine days later the patient's creatine kinase had dropped to 1695 U/L and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for 1 month until his renal function recovered. DISCUSSION: The risk of rhabdomyolysis is increased in the presence of concomitant drugs that inhibit simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is metabolized by CYP3A4. Amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized CYP3A4 inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacokinetic differences in statins are an important consideration for assessing the risk of potential drug interactions. In patients requiring the concurrent use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin carry the lowest risk of drug interactions; atorvastatin carries moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin have the highest risk and should be avoided in patients taking concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors.",1,1,0,0

"Human mutations in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) is a cytosolic enzyme encoded by a housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function is to produce NADPH , a key electron donor in the defense against oxidizing agents and in reductive biosynthetic reactions . Inherited G6PD deficiency is associated with either episodic hemolytic anemia ( triggered by fava beans or other agents ) or life-long hemolytic anemia . We show here that an evolutionary analysis is a key to understanding the biology of a housekeeping gene . From the alignment of the amino acid ( aa ) sequence of 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) species from 42 different organisms , we found a striking correlation between the aa replacements that cause G6PD deficiency in humans and the sequence conservation of G6PD  two-thirds of such replacements are in highly and moderately conserved ( 50-99 % ) aa ; relatively few are in fully conserved aa ( where they might be lethal ) or in poorly conserved aa , where presumably they simply would not cause G6PD deficiency . This is consistent with the notion that all human mutants have residual enzyme activity and that null mutations are lethal at some stage of development . Comparing the distribution of mutations in a human housekeeping gene with evolutionary conservation is a useful tool for pinpointing amino acid residues important for the stability or the function of the corresponding protein . In view of the current explosive increase in full genome sequencing projects , this tool will become rapidly available for numerous other genes . .",0,0,1,0

"A 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results in a kinetic variant of phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disease due to deficiency of a hepatic enzyme , phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . The absence of PAH activity results in typical PKU while persistence of a residual enzyme activity gives rise to variant forms of the disease . We report here a 3-base pair in-frame deletion of the PAH gene ( delta 194 ) in a mild variant , with markedly reduced affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine ( Km = 160 nM ) , and we provide functional evidence for responsibility of the deletion in the mutant phenotype . Since the deletion was located in the third exon of the gene , which presents no homology with other hydroxylases , we suggest that exon 3 is involved in the specificity of the enzyme for phenylalanine . Finally , since none of the 98 PKU patients tested were found to carry this particular deletion , our study suggests that this molecular event probably occurred recently on the background of a haplotype 2 gene in Portugal . .",0,1,1,0

"Low incidence of BRCA2 mutations in breast carcinoma and other cancers. Inherited mutant alleles of familial tumour suppressor genes predispose individuals to particular types of cancer . In addition to an involvement in inherited susceptibility to cancer , these tumour suppressor genes are targets for somatic mutations in sporadic cancers of the same type found in the familial forms . An exception is BRCA1 , which contributes to a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian cancer , but undergoes mutation at very low rates in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers . This finding suggests that other genes may be the principal targets for somatic mutation in breast carcinoma . A second , recently identified familial breast cancer gene , BRCA2 ( refs 5-8 ) , accounts for a proportion of breast cancer roughly equal to BRCA1 . Like BRCA1 , BRCA2 behaves as a dominantly inherited tumour suppressor gene . Individuals who inherit one mutant allele are at increased risk for breast cancer , and the tumours they develop lose the wild-type allele by heterozygous deletion . The BRCA2 coding sequence is huge , composed of 26 exons that span 10 , 443 bp . Here we investigate the rate of BRCA2 mutation in sporadic breast cancers and in a set of cell lines that represent twelve other tumour types . Surprisingly , mutations in BRCA2 are infrequent in cancers including breast carcinoma . However , a probable germline mutation in a pancreatic tumour cell line suggests a role for BRCA2 in susceptibility to pancreatic cancer . .",0,0,1,1

"Acute vocal fold palsy after acute disulfiram intoxication. Acute peripheral neuropathy caused by a disulfiram overdose is very rare and there is no report of it leading to vocal fold palsy. A 49-year-old woman was transferred to our department because of quadriparesis, lancinating pain, sensory loss, and paresthesia of the distal limbs. One month previously, she had taken a single high dose of disulfiram (130 tablets of ALCOHOL STOP TAB, Shin-Poong Pharm. Co., Ansan, Korea) in a suicide attempt. She was not an alcoholic. For the first few days after ingestion, she was in a confused state and had mild to moderate ataxia and giddiness. She noticed hoarseness and distally accentuated motor and sensory dysfunction after she had recovered from this state. A nerve conduction study was consistent with severe sensorimotor axonal polyneuropathy. Laryngeal electromyography (thyroarytenoid muscle) showed ample denervation potentials. Laryngoscopy revealed asymmetric vocal fold movements during phonation. Her vocal change and weakness began to improve spontaneously about 3 weeks after transfer.

"Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene. Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD )or Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus . This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7 , all exons detected by cDNA8 , and the first two exons detected by cDNA9 . These 80 individuals account for approximately 75 % of 109 deletions of the gene , detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA . Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes , p20 ( DXS269 ; Wapenaar et al . ) and GMGX11 ( DXS239 ; present paper ) . Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype . Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD , BMD , or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron / exon boundaries . Of these , eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact , while 21 DMD patients , 7 intermediate patients , and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame . Thus , with two exceptions , frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions .

"An amino-acid substitution involved in phenylketonuria is in linkage disequilibrium with DNA haplotype 2. Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH , phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase , EC 1 . 14 . 16 . 1 ) . PKU is a common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism in caucasian populations and approximately 1 in 50 individuals are carriers of a PKU allele . To define the molecular basis of PKU , we characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism ( RFLP ) haplotypes of the PAH locus in the northern European population and observed that 90 % of the PKU alleles in this population are confined to four common RFLP haplotypes . We have recently reported a splicing mutation in the PAH gene that is associated with RFLP haplotype 3 which is present at about 40 % of mutant alleles . We now report the molecular lesion associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele . This defect is caused by a C-to-T transition in exon 12 resulting in an amino-acid substitution ( Arg to Trp ) at residue 408 of PAH . Direct hybridization analysis of the point mutation using a specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles that make up about 20 % of mutant PAH genes",0,1,0,0

"Ataxin-3 with an altered conformation that exposes the polyglutamine domain is associated with the nuclear matrix. Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 or Machado-Joseph disease ( SCA3 / MJD ) is a member of the CAG / polyglutamine repeat disease family . In this family of disorders , a normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded , resulting in expression of an expanded polyglutamine domain in the disease gene product . Experimental models of polyglutamine disease implicate the nucleus in pathogenesis ; however , the link between intranuclear expression of expanded polyglutamine and neuronal dysfunction remains unclear . Here we demonstrate that ataxin-3 , the disease protein in SCA3 / MJD , adopts a unique conformation when expressed within the nucleus of transfected cells . The monoclonal antibody 1C2 is known preferentially to bind expanded polyglutamine , but we find that it also binds a fragment of ataxin-3 containing a normal glutamine repeat . In addition , expression of ataxin-3 within the nucleus exposes the glutamine domain of the full-length non-pathological protein , allowing it to bind the monoclonal antibody 1C2 . Fractionation and immunochemical experiments indicate that this novel conformation of intranuclear ataxin-3 is not due to proteolysis , suggesting instead that association with nuclear protein ( s ) alters the structure of full-length ataxin-3 which exposes the polyglutamine domain . This conformationally altered ataxin-3 is bound to the nuclear matrix . The pathological form of ataxin-3 with an expanded polyglutamine domain also associates with the nuclear matrix . These data suggest that an early event in the pathogenesis of SCA3 / MJD may be an altered conformation of ataxin-3 within the nucleus that exposes the polyglutamine domain . .",0,0,1,0
"Can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia?. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hemolysis. We aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against anemia. METHODS: Fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis C virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and ribavirin. Serum hemoglobin, haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoetin-2 were investigated before and after therapy. RESULTS: We observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period. Hemoglobin levels also decreased but insignificantly by treatment. In contrast with the literature, serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy. We found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or haptoglobin. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis C and we could not find any relation. Future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy.",0,1,1,0

"Hereditary TP53 codon 292 and somatic P16INK4A codon 94 mutations in a Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by various types of cancer in childhood and adult cases . Although hereditary TP53 mutation is very rare in different human cancers , it has been frequently reported in Li-Fraumeni syndrome . On the other hand , hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A , which affect the cell cycle similar to TP53 , were observed in some types of cancer . In a Turkish family with the diagnosis of Li-Fraumeni syndrome , we analyzed the mutation pattern of TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A in the peripheral blood , and loss of heterozygosity ( homo / hemizygous deletion ) pattern of TP53 and P15INK4B / P16INK4A in two tumor tissues . The propositus had a seminoma , his daughter a medulloblastoma , and one of his healthy cousins , a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation ( AAA-- > ATA ; Lys-- > Ile ) in the peripheral blood cells . Tumor tissue obtained from the propositus with the seminoma revealed loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene . In the analyses of tumor tissues from the propositus and his daughter , a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation ( GCG-- > GAG ; Ala-- > Glu ) was observed with the hereditary TP53 mutation . P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed in our family is a novel mutation in Li-Fraumeni syndrome . No other gene alteration in TP53 , P57KIP2 , P15INK4B , and P16INK4A was observed . Existence of the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation with or without loss of heterozygosity in the TP53 gene ( seminoma / medulloblastoma ) may be evidence for a common mechanism involved in tumorogenesis .

"Cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects of temsirolimus in refractory mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare and aggressive type of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Patients become progressively refractory to conventional chemotherapy, and their prognosis is poor. However, a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor.Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment, and a progression-free survival of 10 months. In this case, lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy. Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells. Apart from this cytostatic effect, temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression. Moreover, numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, compatible with post-necrotic tissue repair, were found after 6-month temsirolimus therapy. Thus, temsirolimus reduced tumor burden through associated cytostatic and anti-angiogenic effects.This dual effect of temsirolimus on tumor tissue could contribute to its recently reported efficiency in refractory MCL resistant to conventional chemotherapy.",0,0,1,1

"Spironolactone-induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart failure. BACKGROUND: A previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported, the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practice. We therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spironolactone. METHODS: We performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practice. Cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >or=2.5 mg/dL), and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per case. Clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries at baseline and follow-up time periods were compared. RESULTS: Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes, had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more likely to be treated with beta-blockers than controls (n = 134). Patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine, required higher doses of loop diuretics, and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than controls. CONCLUSIONS: Spironolactone-induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previously. This difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta-blockers.",1,1,0,0
"Effect of intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol plus glucagon on dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing with technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the impact of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's effects. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Community hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-two patients with known reversible perfusion defects. INTERVENTION: Patients underwent dobutamine stress tests per standard protocol. Before dobutamine was begun, no therapy was given during the first visit, and patients were randomized on subsequent visits to receive metoprolol or metoprolol plus glucagon 1 mg. Metoprolol was dosed to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Metoprolol reduced maximum heart rate 31%, summed stress scores 29%, and summed difference scores 43% versus control. Metoprolol plus glucagon also reduced the maximum heart rate 29% versus control. Summed stress and summed difference scores were not significantly reduced, although they were 18% and 30% lower, respectively, than control. No significant differences were found in any parameter between metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon. CONCLUSION: During dobutamine stress testing, metoprolol attenuates or eliminates evidence of myocardial ischemia. Glucagon 1 mg, although somewhat effective, does not correct this effect to the extent that it can be administered clinically.",1,0,0,0

"Urinary bladder cancer in Wegener's granulomatosis: risks and relation to cyclophosphamide. OBJECTIVE: To assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer, and its relation to cyclophosphamide, in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. METHODS: In the population based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, 1969-95, was identified. Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register, all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified. Nested within the cohort, a matched case-control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios (ORs) as relative risk. In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener's granulomatosis, and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, were also estimated. RESULTS: The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases (n = 11) and controls (n = 25) were 113 g and 25 g, respectively. The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 4.9). Treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69). The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, and a history of bladder cancer was (non-significantly) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a dose-response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer, high cumulative risks in the entire cohort, and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before Wegener's granulomatosis.",0,0,0,1

"Contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in rostral and intermediate-caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rats. The aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone. Muscle tone was examined using a combined mechanoand electromyographic method, which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance (MMG) of the rat's hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity (EMG) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint: gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior. Muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid (5,7-DCKA), a selective glycine site antagonist, injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg/0.5 microl bilaterally, into the rostral region of the striatum, decreased both the haloperidol-induced muscle rigidity (MMG) and the enhanced electromyographic activity (EMG). 5,7-DCKA injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg/0.5 microl into the intermediate-caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle tone. The present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of NMDA receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the antiparkinsonian action of this drug.",0,0,1,0
"Adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C. BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin. Because of ribavirin-related hemolytic anemia, dose reduction is a common event in this therapy. In this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven of 160 patients who had HCV-genotype 1b, had high virus load, and received 24-week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level <10 g/dl or anemia-related signs during therapy. After that, these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin (200 mg) per day. After reduction of ribavirin, 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks (group A). However, 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their <8.5 g/dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia-related severe side effects occurred (group B). We assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups A and B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was 29.6% (8/27) in group A and 10% (1/10) in group B, respectively. A 34.4% (12/27) of SVR + biological response in group A was higher than 10% (1/10) in group B ( P = 0.051), with slight significance. With respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction, a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with > or =10 g/dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with <10 g/dl ( P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level > or =10 g/dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects.",0,1,1,0

"Diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rats. The effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rats. Intravenous administration of diazepam (1-30 mg kg-1) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. Also, reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline (1.25-2.5 micrograms kg-1). Intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam, although causing no change in the adrenaline-induced pressor effect, did enhance the adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia. However, the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline-induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picrotoxin (an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex). The data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine-GABA-chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure.",1,1,1,0
"Localisation of the Becker muscular dystrophy gene on the short arm of the X chromosome by linkage to cloned DNA sequences. A linkage study in 30 Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) kindreds using three cloned DNA sequences from the X chromosome which demonstrate restriction fragment length polymorphisms ( RFLPs ) , suggests that the BMD gene is located on the short arm of the X chromosome , in the p21 region . The genes for Becker and Duchenne dystrophies must therefore be closely linked , if not allelic , and any future DNA probes found to be of practical use in one disorder should be equally applicable to the other .

"Effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (Captopril) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat. Induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man. Injection of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model. The lung weights were lower and PaO2 was improved in rats given this enzyme-blocking agent. The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed, indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein. Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril. The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone. It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin (secondary to an increase in bradykinin). Captopril may, by the same mechanism, reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli, with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced.",0,1,0,0
"The correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mipafox-induced neuropathic damage in rats. The correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme (NTE) was examined in rats acutely exposed to Mipafox (N, N'-diisopropylphosphorodiamidofluoridate), a neurotoxic organophosphate. Brain and spinal cord NTE activities were measured in Long-Evans male rats 1 hr post-exposure to various dosages of Mipafox (ip, 1-15 mg/kg). These data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14-21 days post-exposure. Those dosages (greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg) that inhibited mean NTE activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73% and brain greater than or equal to 67% of control values produced severe (greater than or equal to 3) cervical cord pathology in 85% of the rats. In contrast, dosages of Mipafox (less than or equal to 5 mg/kg) which inhibited mean NTE activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61% and brain less than or equal to 60% produced this degree of cord damage in only 9% of the animals. These data indicate that a critical percentage of NTE inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after Mipafox exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later.",0,0,1,0

"Loss of normal allele of the APC gene in an adrenocortical carcinoma from a patient with familial adenomatous polyposis. Endocrine neoplasms have been reported occasionally in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . An adrenocorotical carcinoma was studied in a patient with a family history of FAP . Loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) in the region close to the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene was detected in this carcinoma , and evidence was obtained that there was a loss of the normal allele of the APC gene . This is the first demonstration of LOH at the APC locus in adrenocortical tumors . The present results and our previous data on LOH in a recurring desmoid tumor suggest that the heterozygous mutant / wild-type condition of the APC gene may give rise to benign tumors , and that functional loss of this gene leads to development of tumors not only in the colon but also in other various parts of the body in FAP patients . .",0,0,1,1
"The gene for spinal cerebellar ataxia 3 (SCA3) is located in a region of approximately 3 cM on chromosome 14q24. 3-q32.2.

"Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat: efficacy, toxicity, and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations. Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a commonly used AED, has been implicated in some clinical studies. A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat. In the course of developing this model, a common vehicle, propylene glycol, by itself in high doses, was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Seizures induced by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by CBZ than seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg/kg was continuously protective against HFDE-induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treatment. The CBZ levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals, however, were below those normally considered protective. This treatment with CBZ had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat, and, indeed, the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment.",0,1,1,0
"Longitudinal association of alcohol use with HIV disease progression and psychological health of women with HIV. We evaluated the association of alcohol consumption and depression, and their effects on HIV disease progression among women with HIV. The study included 871 women with HIV who were recruited from 1993-1995 in four US cities. The participants had physical examination, medical record extraction, and venipuncture, CD4+T-cell counts determination, measurement of depression symptoms (using the self-report Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale), and alcohol use assessment at enrollment, and semiannually until March 2000. Multilevel random coefficient ordinal models as well as multilevel models with joint responses were used in the analysis. There was no significant association between level of alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell counts. When participants were stratified by antiretroviral therapy (ART) use, the association between alcohol and CD4+ T-cell did not reach statistical significance. The association between alcohol consumption and depression was significant (p<0.001). Depression had a significant negative effect on CD4+ T-cell counts over time regardless of ART use. Our findings suggest that alcohol consumption has a direct association with depression. Moreover, depression is associated with HIV disease progression.

"The negative mucosal potential: separating central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs in man. OBJECTIVE: We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain-related signal (chemo-somatosensory evoked potential, CSSEP) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal (negative mucosal potential, NMP) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs. For this purpose, experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms. METHODS: According to a double-blind, randomised, controlled, threefold cross-over design, 18 healthy subjects (11 males, 7 females; mean age 26 years) received either placebo, 400 mg ibuprofen, or 800 mg ibuprofen. Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa (stimulus duration 500 ms, interval approximately 60 s), and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature, humidity and flow rate (22 degrees C, 0% relative humidity, 145 ml.s-1). Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli. Additionally, the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales. RESULTS: As described earlier, administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but-relative to placebo-an increase in correlates of phasic pain, indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions. Based on the similar behaviour of CSSEP and NMP, it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periphery. By means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception, it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an NSAID. The major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain-related activity directly using a non-invasive technique in humans.",0,0,1,0

"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. In a placebo-controlled, single-blinded, crossover study, we assessed the effect of ""real"" repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus ""sham"" rTMS (placebo) on peak dose dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Ten patients with PD and prominent dyskinesias had rTMS (1,800 pulses; 1 Hz rate) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice, once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment series. Direct comparison between sham and real rTMS effects showed no significant difference in clinician-assessed dyskinesia severity. However, comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rTMS but not placebo. The major effect was on dystonia subscore. Similarly, in patient diaries, although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention, the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rTMS only. Following rTMS, no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and PD symptoms were noted. The results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical aftereffects of consecutive daily applications of low-frequency rTMS on dyskinesias in PD. The effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses.",0,1,1,0
"Tachyphylaxis to systemic but not to airway responses during prolonged therapy with high dose inhaled salbutamol in asthmatics. High doses of inhaled salbutamol produce substantial improvements in airway response in patients with asthma, and are associated with dose-dependent systemic beta-adrenoceptor responses. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether tachyphylaxis occurs during prolonged treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol. Twelve asthmatic patients (FEV1, 81 +/- 4% predicted), requiring only occasional inhaled beta-agonists as their sole therapy, were given a 14-day treatment with high dose inhaled salbutamol (HDS), 4,000 micrograms daily, low dose inhaled salbutamol (LDS), 800 micrograms daily, or placebo (PI) by metered-dose inhaler in a double-blind, randomized crossover design. During the 14-day run-in and during washout periods, inhaled beta-agonists were withheld and ipratropium bromide was substituted for rescue purposes. At the end of each 14-day treatment, a dose-response curve (DRC) was performed, and airway (FEV1, FEF25-75) chronotropic (HR), tremor, and metabolic (K, Glu) responses were measured at each step (from 100 to 4,000 micrograms). Treatment had no significant effect on baseline values. There were dose-dependent increases in FEV1 and FEF25-75 (p less than 0.001), and pretreatment with HDS did not displace the DRC to the right. DRC for HR (p less than 0.001), K (p less than 0.001), and Glu (p less than 0.005) were attenuated after treatment with HDS compared with PI. There were also differences between HDS and LDS for HR (p less than 0.001) and Glu (p less than 0.05) responses. Frequency and severity of subjective adverse effects were also reduced after HDS: tremor (p less than 0.001), palpitations (p less than 0.001).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,1,0

"Phlorizin-induced glycosuria does not prevent gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats. Because rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus (DM) have a high solute diuresis (glycosuria of 10 to 12 g/day), we have suggested that this may in part be responsible for their resistance to gentamicin-induced acute renal failure (ARF). The protection from gentamicin nephrotoxicity was studied in non-diabetic rats with chronic solute diuresis induced by blockage of tubular glucose reabsorption with phlorizin (P). DM rats with mild glycosuria (similar in degree to that of the P treated animals) were also studied. Unanesthetized adult female, Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in four groups and studied for 15 days. Group 1 (P alone) received P, 360 mg/day, for 15 days; Group II (P + gentamicin); Group III (gentamicin alone) and Group IV (mild DM + gentamicin). Nephrotoxic doses (40 mg/kg body wt/day) of gentamicin were injected during the last nine days of study to the animals of groups II to IV. In Group I, P induced a moderate and stable glycosuria (3.9 +/- 0.1 g/day, SE), and no functional or morphologic evidence of renal dysfunction (baseline CCr 2.1 +/- 0.1 ml/min, undetectable lysozymuria) or damage (tubular necrosis score [maximum 4], zero). In Group II, P did not prevent gentamicin-ARF (maximal decrease in CCr at day 9.89%, P less than 0.001; peak lysozymuria, 1863 +/- 321 micrograms/day; and tubular necrosis score, 3.9 +/- 0.1). These values were not different from those of Group III: maximal decrease in CCr 73% (P less than 0.001); lysozymuria, 2147 +/- 701 micrograms/day; tubular necrosis score, 3.8 +/- 0.1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,1,1,0

"Rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated Iranian patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. BACKGROUND: Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients. Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants (resistant hepatitis B virus) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients. In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study. Serum samples from patients were tested by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) for detection of YMDD motif mutants. All patients were also tested for liver enzymes, anti-HCV, HBeAg, and anti-HBe. RESULTS: Of the 77 patients enrolled in the study, 73% were male and 27% were female. Mean ALT and AST levels were 124.4+/-73.4 and 103.1+/-81 IU/l, respectively. HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti-HBe in 60% of the patients. Anti-HCV was negative in all of them. YMDD motif mutants were not detected in any of the patients despite the liver enzyme levels and the presence of HBeAg or anti-HBe. CONCLUSION: Although the natural occurrence of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine-untreated patients with chronic hepatitis B has been reported, these mutants were not detected in Iranian lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients.",0,1,0,0
"Causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transplantation. OBJECTIVES: Thrombotic microangiopathy is a well-known problem in patients following renal transplantation. In postrenal transplantation, thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syndrome. We aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies (n=25) performed during this interval. Pre- and posttransplant crossmatching was done when possible. RESULTS: Five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found. Three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow-up. Three cases were related to cyclosporine, and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature, the most-frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syndrome. Other causes include drug-related (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) toxicity, procoagulant status, and antibody-mediated rejection. We found that the most-frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related, secondary mainly to cyclosporine. In the current study, the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature (20%).",0,1,0,0

"A transient neurological deficit following intrathecal injection of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine for unilateral spinal anaesthesia. We describe a case of transient neurological deficit that occurred after unilateral spinal anaesthesia with 8 mg of 1% hyperbaric bupivacaine slowly injected through a 25-gauge pencil-point spinal needle. The surgery and anaesthesia were uneventful, but 3 days after surgery, the patient reported an area of hypoaesthesia over L3-L4 dermatomes of the leg which had been operated on (loss of pinprick sensation) without reduction in muscular strength. Sensation in this area returned to normal over the following 2 weeks. Prospective multicentre studies with a large population and a long follow-up should be performed in order to evaluate the incidence of this unusual side effect. However, we suggest that a low solution concentration should be preferred for unilateral spinal anaesthesia with a hyperbaric anaesthetic solution (if pencil-point needle and slow injection rate are employed), in order to minimize the risk of a localized high peak anaesthetic concentration, which might lead to a transient neurological deficit.",0,0,1,0
"Thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia during all-trans-retinoic acid therapy. A case of acute renal failure, due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and tranexamic acid has been described recently. We report a case of acute renal failure in an APL patient treated with ATRA alone. This case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with ATRA therapy in APL patients. The patients, a 43-year-old man, presented all the signs and symptoms of APL and was included in a treatment protocol with ATRA. After 10 days of treatment, he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of APL was achieved and therapy discontinued.

"Linkage of DNA markers at Xq28 to adrenoleukodystrophy and adrenomyeloneuropathy present within the same family. We present a large kindred that contained patients with either adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) or adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) . The pedigree clearly supported the X-linked mode of inheritance of the nonneonatal form of ALD / AMN . Analysis with DNA markers at Xq28 suggested segregation of both ALD and AMN with an identical haplotype . This indicated that nonneonatal ALD and AMN are caused by a mutation in the same gene at Xq28 . It showed , furthermore , that phenotypic differences between ALD and AMN are not necessarily the consequence of allelic heterogeneity due to different mutations within the same gene . The maximal lod score for linkage of the ALD / AMN gene and the multiallelic anonymous DNA marker at DXS52 was 3 . 0 at a recombination fraction of 0 . 00 . This made a prenatal or presymptomatic diagnosis and heterozygote detection by DNA analysis with this marker reliable .",0,0,1,0
"Anorexigens and pulmonary hypertension in the United States: results from the surveillance of North American pulmonary hypertension. BACKGROUND: The use of appetite suppressants in Europe has been associated with the development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Recently, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America. Data collected on patients seen from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity. Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH. A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-nine patients were studied, 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes (secondary pulmonary hypertension [SPH]). The use of anorexigens was common in both groups. However, of the medications surveyed, only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). The association was stronger with longer duration of use when compared to shorter duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users than in remote users. An unexpectedly high (11.4%) number of patients with SPH had used anorexigens. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of the association with PPH, the increase of association with increasing duration of use, and the specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous studies indicating that fenfluramines are causally related to PPH. The high prevalence of anorexigen use in patients with SPH also raises the possibility that these drugs precipitate pulmonary hypertension in patients with underlying conditions associated with SPH.",1,0,0,0
"Submicroscopic deletion in cousins with Prader-Willi syndrome causes a grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern: effects of imprinting. The Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) critical region on 15q11-q13 is subject to imprinting . PWS becomes apparent when genes on the paternally inherited chromosome are not expressed . Familial PWS is rare . We report on a family in which a male and a female paternal first cousin both have PWS with cytogenetically normal karyotypes . Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analysis shows a submicroscopic deletion of SNRPN , but not the closely associated loci D15S10 , D15S11 , D15S63 , and GABRB3 . The cousins fathers and two paternal aunts have the same deletion and are clinically normal . The grandmother of the cousins is deceased and not available for study , and their grandfather is not deleted for SNRPN .

"Cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion. Barium-supplemented Long-Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium (100 micrograms/ml mineral fortified water) treatment. Analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability, contractility, and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium-induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system. The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital. Under barbiturate anesthesia, virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium-exposed rats relative to the corresponding control-fed rats. The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium-treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic, and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response. Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest, irrespective of the anesthetic employed. The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium-treated rats relative to the control groups, irrespective of the anesthetic regimen. Similarly, significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium-exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity. In addition, the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium-exposed rats. Overall, the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics, the myocardial metabolic disturbances, and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure. These experimental findings represent the first indication that life-long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system.",1,0,1,0

"Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside-induced hypotension. The effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40-50 per cent. Before nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly, P less than .05, decreased arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Ten cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate, but did not change cardiac output or QS/QT. Five cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above-mentioned variables. However, 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS/QT. During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics, but high levels of CPAP (10 cm H2O), while decreasing QS/QT, produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",1,0,0,0

"A phase II study of thalidomide in advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the toxicity and activity of thalidomide in patients with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer and to measure changes of one angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165, with therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients were enrolled on a study of thalidomide using an intra-patient dose escalation schedule. Patients began thalidomide at 400 mg/d and escalated as tolerated to 1200 mg/d by day 54. Fifty-nine per cent of patients had had previous therapy with IL-2 and 52% were performance status 2 or 3. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels were measured by dual monoclonal ELISA in 8 patients. RESULTS: 24 patients were evaluable for response with one partial response of 11 months duration of a patient with hepatic and pulmonary metastases (4%), one minor response, and 2 patients stable for over 6 months. Somnolence and constipation were prominent toxicities and most patients could not tolerate the 1200 mg/day dose level. Systemic plasma VEGF165 levels did not change with therapy. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with a low level of activity of thalidomide in renal cell carcinoma. Administration of doses over 800 mg/day was difficult to achieve in this patient population, however lower doses were practical. The dose-response relationship, if any, of thalidomide for renal cell carcinoma is unclear.",0,1,0,1

"Effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin-induced nephropathy. The effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was assessed in Munich-Wistar rats with established adriamycin nephrosis. Rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. Groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enalapril. Groups 1 and 2 underwent micropuncture studies after 10 days. These short-term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P less than 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P less than 0.05) without reducing albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). Groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis. Chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4. Untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months, 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). Enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in GFR in group 4 (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months, 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P less than 0.05 vs. group 3).

"Support for adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis: 18 hour pressor effect after 6 hours adrenaline infusion. In a double blind, crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), and a 5% dextrose solution (5.4 ml/h), were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks apart. By means of intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stopped. Adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, caused a delayed and protracted pressor effect. Over the total postinfusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 (SEM 2)% and 7 (2)%, respectively, higher than after dextrose infusion (ANOVA, p less than 0.001). Thus, ""stress"" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effect. These findings are strong support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in man.",1,1,0,0

"Effect of calcium chloride and 4-aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rats. BACKGROUND: Hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant overdose. Recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissues. This study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension. METHODS: Two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker overdose. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine. Anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP to produce hypotension, QRS prolongation, and bradycardia. Fifteen min later, animals received CaCl2, NaHCO3, or saline. In a second experiment, rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine IP followed in 15 min by 4-aminopyridine or saline. RESULTS: NaHCO3 briefly (5 min) reversed hypotension and QRS prolongation. CaCl2 and 4-aminopyridine failed to improve blood pressure. The incidence of ventricular arrhythmias (p = 0.004) and seizures (p = 0.03) in the CaCl2 group was higher than the other groups. CONCLUSION: The administration of CaCl2 or 4-aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension in rats. CaCl2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxicity. These findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant-induced hypotension.",1,0,1,0
"Intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin combined with lamivudine in prevention of hepatitis B recurrence after liver transplantation. BACKGROUND: Combined hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine in prophylaxis of the recurrence of hepatitis B after liver transplantation has significantly improved the survival of HBsAg positive patients. This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV). METHODS: A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients (43 men and 8 women) transplanted for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months. HBIg was administered intravenously during the first week and intramuscularly thereafter. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 14.1 months, the overall recurrence rate in the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). The overall patient survival was 88.3%, and 82.4% after 1 and 2 years, respectively. A daily oral dose of 100 mg lamivudine for 2 weeks before transplantation for 10 patients enabled 57.1% (4/7) and 62.5% (5/8) of HBV-DNA and HBeAg positive patients respectively to convert to be negative. Intramuscular HBIg was well tolerated in all patients. CONCLUSION: Lamivudine combined with intramuscular HBIg can effectively prevent allograft from the recurrence of HBV after liver transplantation.",0,1,0,0
"Incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II and postoperative recovery of platelet count in liver graft recipients: a retrospective cohort analysis. BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia in patients with end-stage liver disease is a common disorder caused mainly by portal hypertension, low levels of thrombopoetin, and endotoxemia. The impact of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation is not yet understood, with few literature citations reporting contradictory results. The aim of our study was to demonstrate the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and determine the occurrence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver disease. Preoperative platelet count, postoperative course of platelets, and clinical signs of HIT type II were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients had thrombocytopenia before transplantation, significantly influenced by Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count exceeded 100,000/uL in most of the patients (n = 193) at a medium of 7 d. Regarding HIT II, there were four (1.95%) patients with a background of HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is, with about 1.95%, rare. For further reduction of HIT type II, the use of intravenous heparin should be avoided and the prophylactic anticoagulation should be performed with low-molecular-weight heparin after normalization of platelet count.",1,1,0,0
"Alpha and beta coma in drug intoxication uncomplicated by cerebral hypoxia. Four patients who were rendered comatose or stuporous by drug intoxication, but who were not hypoxic, are described. Three patients received high doses of chlormethiazole for alcohol withdrawal symptoms, and one took a suicidal overdose of nitrazepam. The patient with nitrazepam overdose and two of those with chlormethiazole intoxication conformed to the criteria of 'alpha coma', showing non-reactive generalized or frontally predominant alpha activity in the EEG. The fourth patient who was unconscious after chlormethiazole administration exhibite generalized non-reactive activity in the slow beta range. All four recovered completely without neurological sequelae following the withdrawal of the offending agents. The similarities between the effects of structural lesions and pharmacological depression of the brain stem reticular formation are discussed. It is suggested that in both situations disturbed reticulo-thalamic interactions are important in the pathogenesis of alpha coma.

We have identified WASP , the protein that is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) , as a novel effector for CDC42Hs , but not for the other Rho family members , Rac and Rho . This interaction is dependent on the presence of the G protein-binding domain . Cellular expression of epitope-tagged WASP produces clusters of WASP that are highly enriched in polymerized actin . This clustering is not observed with a C-terminally deleted WASP and is inhibited by coexpression with dominant negative CDC42Hs-N17 , but not with dominant negative forms of Rac or Rho . Thus , WASP provides a novel link between CDC42Hs and the actin cytoskeleton , which suggests a molecular mechanism for many of the cellular abnormalities in WAS .

"Sub-chronic inhibition of nitric-oxide synthesis modifies haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NADPH-diaphorase neurons in mice. RATIONALE: NG-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG), an inhibitor of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS), induces catalepsy in mice. This effect undergoes rapid tolerance, showing a significant decrease after 2 days of sub-chronic L-NOARG treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) has been shown to influence dopaminergic neurotransmission in the striatum. Neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol, which block dopamine receptors, also cause catalepsy in rodents. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of subchronic L-NOARG treatment in haloperidol-induced catalepsy and the number of NOS neurons in areas related to motor control. METHODS: Male albino Swiss mice were treated sub-chronically (twice a day for 4 days) with L-NOARG (40 mg/kg i.p.) or haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.). Catalepsy was evaluated at the beginning and the end of the treatments. Reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry was also employed to visualize NOS as an index of enzyme expression in mice brain regions related to motor control. RESULTS: L-NOARG sub-chronic administration produced tolerance of L-NOARG and of haloperidol-induced catalepsy. It also induced an increase in the number of NADPH-d-positive cells in the dorsal part of the caudate and accumbens nuclei compared with haloperidol and in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus compared with saline. In contrast, there was a decrease in NADPH-d neuron number in the substantia nigra, pars compacta in both haloperidol-treated and L-NOARG-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS: The results give further support to the hypothesis that NO plays a role in motor behavior control and suggest that it may take part in the synaptic changes produced by antipsychotic treatment.",0,0,1,0

"Growth-associated protein 43 expression in hippocampal molecular layer of chronic epileptic rats treated with cycloheximide. PURPOSE: GAP43 has been thought to be linked with mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) in various experimental models of epilepsy. To investigate how GAP43 expression (GAP43-ir) correlates with MFS, we assessed the intensity (densitometry) and extension (width) of GAP43-ir in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (IML) of rats subject to status epilepticus induced by pilocarpine (Pilo), previously injected or not with cycloheximide (CHX), which has been shown to inhibit MFS. METHODS: CHX was injected before the Pilo injection in adult Wistar rats. The Pilo group was injected with the same drugs, except for CHX. Animals were killed between 30 and 60 days later, and brain sections were processed for GAP43 immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo, CHX+Pilo, and control groups. However, the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that CHX+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band (p = 0.03) as compared with that in the Pilo group. CONCLUSIONS: Our current finding that animals in the CHX+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML, similar to that of controls, reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals. The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo-treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43.",0,0,1,0

"Long-term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male Wistar rats treated intracerebroventricularly with streptozotocin. Basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (sAD) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin-receptor (IR) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter GLUT4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cells. An alternative source of energy is d-galactose (the C-4-epimer of d-glucose) which is transported into the brain by insulin-independent GLUT3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the Leloir pathway. Exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model, but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been tested. We have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose (200 mg/kg/day) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin-induced (STZ-icv) rat model of sAD, tested by Morris Water Maze and Passive Avoidance test, respectively. One month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the STZ-icv administration, successfully prevented development of the STZ-icv-induced cognitive deficits. Beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg/kg/day. Additionally, oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood. The increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dose. Oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hypometabolism in AD.",0,0,1,0
"Spectrum of hSNF5/INI1 somatic mutations in human cancer and genotype-phenotype correlations. The hSNF5 / INI1 gene which encodes a member of the SWI / SNF chromatin ATP-dependent remodeling complex , is a new tumor suppressor gene localized on chromosome 22q11 . 2 and recently shown to be mutated in malignant rhabdoid tumors . We have searched for hSNF5 / INI1 mutations in 229 tumors of various origins using a screening method based on denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography . A total of 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations were identified . Point mutations were scattered along the coding sequence and included 15 nonsense , 15 frameshift , three splice site , two missense and one editing mutations . Mutations were retrieved in most rhabdoid tumors , whatever their sites of occurrence , indicating the common pathogenetic origin of these tumors . Recurrent hSNF5 / INI1 alterations were also observed in choroid plexus carcinomas and in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors ( cPNETs ) and medulloblastomas .

These results suggest that rhabdoid tumors , choroid plexus carcinomas and a subset of medulloblastomas and cPNETs share common pathways of oncogenesis related to hSNF5 / INI1 alteration and that hSNF5 / INI1 mutations define a genetically homogeneous family of highly aggressive cancers mainly occurring in young children and frequently , but not always , exhibiting a rhabdoid phenotype",0,0,1,1
"Transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with expanded CTG repeat mimic closely the DM CTG repeat intergenerational and somatic instability. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by a CTG repeat expansion in the 3UTR of the DM protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene . A very high level of instability is observed through successive generations and the size of the repeat is generally correlated with the severity of the disease and with age at onset . Furthermore , tissues from DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism that increases with age . We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences with 20 , 55 or > 300 CTG , cloned from patients from the same affected DM family . Using large human flanking sequences and a large amplification , we demonstrate that the intergenerational CTG repeat instability is reproduced in mice , with a strong bias towards expansions and with the same sex- and size-dependent characteristics as in humans . Moreover , a high level of instability , increasing with age , can be observed in tissues and in sperm . Although we did not observe dramatic expansions ( or big jumps over several hundred CTG repeats ) as in congenital forms of DM , our model carrying > 300 CTG is the first to show instability so close to the human DM situation . Our three models carrying different sizes of CTG repeat provide insight on the different factors modulating the CTG repeat instability . .",0,0,1,0

"The risk of venous thromboembolism in women prescribed cyproterone acetate in combination with ethinyl estradiol: a nested cohort analysis and case-control study. BACKGROUND: Cyproterone acetate combined with ethinyl estradiol (CPA/EE) is licensed in the UK for the treatment of women with acne and hirsutism and is also a treatment option for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Previous studies have demonstrated an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) associated with CPA/EE compared with conventional combined oral contraceptives (COCs). We believe the results of those studies may have been affected by residual confounding. METHODS: Using the General Practice Research Database we conducted a cohort analysis and case-control study nested within a population of women aged between 15 and 39 years with acne, hirsutism or PCOS to estimate the risk of VTE associated with CPA/EE. RESULTS: The age-adjusted incidence rate ratio for CPA/EE versus conventional COCs was 2.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-3.58]. Using as the reference group women who were not using oral contraception, had no recent pregnancy or menopausal symptoms, the case-control analysis gave an adjusted odds ratio (OR(adj)) of 7.44 (95% CI 3.67-15.08) for CPA/EE use compared with an OR(adj) of 2.58 (95% CI 1.60-4.18) for use of conventional COCs. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated an increased risk of VTE associated with the use of CPA/EE in women with acne, hirsutism or PCOS although residual confounding by indication cannot be excluded.",0,0,1,0

"Classical galactosemia and mutations at the galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene. Classical galactosemia is caused by a deficiency in activity of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase ( GALT ) , which , in turn , is caused by mutations at the GALT gene . The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and , at the end of 1998 , more than 150 different base changes were recorded in 24 different populations and ethnic groups in 15 countries worldwide . The mutations most frequently cited are Q188R , K285N , S135L , and N314D . Q188R is the most common mutation in European populations or in those predominantly of European descent . Overall , it accounts for 60-70 % of mutant chromosomes , but there are significant differences in its relative frequency in individual populations . Individuals homoallelic for Q188R tend to have a severe phenotype and this is in keeping with the virtually complete loss of enzyme activity observed in in vitro expression systems . Globally , K285N is rarer , but in many European populations it can be found on 25-40 % of mutant chromosomes . It is invariably associated with a severe phenotype . S135L is found almost exclusively in African Americans . In vitro expression results are discrepant , but some individuals carrying S135L appear to exhibit GALT activity in some tissues . Duarte 1 ( or Los Angeles ) and Duarte 2 ( or Duarte ) variants carry the same amino acid substitution , N314D , even though D1 is associated with increased erythrocyte GALT activity and D2 with reduced activity . N314D is in linkage disequilibrium with other base changes that differ on the D1 and D2 alleles . N314D does not impair GALT activity in in vitro expression systems . However , there are differences in the abundance of GALT protein in lymphoblastoid cells lines from D2 and D1 individuals . It is unclear whether the specific molecular changes that distinguish the D1 and D2 alleles account for the different activities . The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented to date undoubtedly contributes to the phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed in galactosemia . The additional effects of nonallelic variation and other constitutional factors on phenotypic variability remain to be elucidated . .",0,0,1,0

"Role of activation of bradykinin B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Cellular mechanisms which account for disruption the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension are not clear. The goal of this study was to determine the role of synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors in disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension. Permeability of the blood-brain barrier was quantitated by clearance of fluorescent-labeled dextran before and during phenylephrine-induced acute hypertension in rats treated with vehicle and Hoe-140 (0.1 microM). Phenylephrine infusion increased arterial pressure, arteriolar diameter and clearance of fluorescent dextran by a similar magnitude in both groups. These findings suggest that disruption of the blood-brain barrier during acute hypertension is not related to the synthesis/release of bradykinin to activate B2 receptors.",1,0,1,0

"Potential therapeutic use of the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist, A-86929: an acute study in parkinsonian levodopa-primed monkeys. The clinical utility of dopamine (DA) D1 receptor agonists in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) is still unclear. The therapeutic use of selective DA D1 receptor agonists such as SKF-82958 (6-chloro-7,8-dihydroxy-3-allyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzaze pine hydrobromide) and A-77636 ([1R, 3S] 3-[1'-admantyl]-1-aminomethyl-3,4-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxy-1H-2-benzo pyran hydrochloride) seems limited because of their duration of action, which is too short for SKF-82958 (< 1 hr) and too long for A-77636 (> 20 hr, leading to behavioral tolerance). We therefore conducted the present acute dose-response study in four 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-exposed cynomolgus monkeys primed to exhibit levodopa-induced dyskinesias to evaluate the locomotor and dyskinetic effects on challenge with four doses (from 0.03 to 1.0 mg/kg) of A-86929 ([-]-[5aR,11bS]-4,5,5a,6,7,11b-hexahydro-2-propyl-3-thia-5-+ ++azacyclopent-1- ena[c]phenathrene-9-10-diol), a selective and full DA D1-like receptor agonist with an intermediate duration of action. Levodopa and the DA D2-like receptor agonist, LY-171555 ([4aR-trans]-4,4a,5,6,7,8,8a,9-o-dihydro-5n-propyl-2H-pyrazo lo-3-4-quinoline hydrochloride) were also used for comparison. Acute administration of A-86929 was as efficacious in alleviating MPTP-induced parkinsonism as levodopa and LY-171555, but was less likely to reproduce the levodopa-induced dyskinesias in these animals than with either LY-171555 or subsequent challenge of levodopa. Selective stimulation of the DA D1 receptor may provide better integration of neural inputs transmitted to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (referred to as the basal ganglia output) compared with levodopa and selective DA D2 receptor agonist. Potent DA D1 receptor agents with an intermediate duration of efficacy such as A-86929 (approximately 4 hr at higher doses tested) are potential therapeutic tools in PD and merit further attention.",0,0,1,0
"Hyperalgesia and myoclonus in terminal cancer patients treated with continuous intravenous morphine. Eight cancer patients in the terminal stages of the disease treated with high doses of intravenous morphine developed hyperalgesia. All cases were retrospectively sampled from three different hospitals in Copenhagen. Five patients developed universal hyperalgesia and hyperesthesia which in 2 cases were accompanied by myoclonus. In 3 patients a pre-existing neuralgia increased to excruciating intensity and in 2 of these cases myoclonus occurred simultaneously. Although only few clinical descriptions of the relationship between hyperalgesia/myoclonus and high doses of morphine are available, experimental support from animal studies indicates that morphine, or its metabolites, plays a causative role for the observed behavioural syndrome. The possible mechanisms are discussed and treatment proposals given suggesting the use of more efficacious opioids with less excitatory potency in these situations.",0,0,1,1
"Behavioral and neurochemical studies in mice pretreated with garcinielliptone FC in pilocarpine-induced seizures. Garcinielliptone FC (GFC) isolated from hexanic fraction seed extract of species Platonia insignis Mart. It is widely used in folk medicine to treat skin diseases in both humans and animals as well as the seed decoction has been used to treat diarrheas and inflammatory diseases. However, there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents. The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25, 50 or 75 mg/kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid (r-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamine, aspartate and glutathione) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures. GFC produced an increased latency to first seizure, at doses 25mg/kg (20.12 + 2.20 min), 50mg/kg (20.95 + 2.21 min) or 75 mg/kg (23.43 + 1.99 min) when compared with seized mice. In addition, GABA content of mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase of 46.90% when compared with seized mice. In aspartate, glutamine and glutamate levels detected a decrease of 5.21%, 13.55% and 21.80%, respectively in mice hippocampus treated with GFC75 plus P400 when compared with seized mice. Hippocampus mice treated with GFC75 plus P400 showed an increase in AChE activity (63.30%) when compared with seized mice. The results indicate that GFC can exert anticonvulsant activity and reduce the frequency of installation of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus, as demonstrated by increase in latency to first seizure and decrease in mortality rate of animals. In conclusion, our data suggest that GFC may influence in epileptogenesis and promote anticonvulsant actions in pilocarpine model by modulating the GABA and glutamate contents and of AChE activity in seized mice hippocampus. This compound may be useful to produce neuronal protection and it can be considered as an anticonvulsant agent.",0,0,1,0
"Amiodarone-induced torsade de pointes during bladder irrigation: an unusual presentation--a case report. The authors present a case of early (within 4 days) development of torsade de pointes (TdP) associated with oral amiodarone therapy. Consistent with other reports this case of TdP occurred in the context of multiple exacerbating factors including hypokalemia and digoxin excess. Transient prolongation of the QT during bladder irrigation prompted the episode of TdP. It is well known that bradycardia exacerbates acquired TdP. The authors speculate that the increased vagal tone during bladder irrigation, a vagal maneuver, in the context of amiodarone therapy resulted in amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. In the absence of amiodarone therapy, a second bladder irrigation did not induce TdP despite hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.",1,0,0,0
"Comparative genome mapping of the ataxia-telangiectasia region in mouse, rat, and Syrian hamster. Chromosomal locations of the Atm ( ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) -mutated ) and Acat1 ( mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase ) genes in mouse , rat , and Syrian hamster were determined by direct R-banding FISH . Both genes were colocalized to the C-D band of mouse chromosome 9 , the proximal end of q24 . 1 of rat chromosome 8 , and qa4-qa5 of Syrian hamster chromosome 12 . The regions in the mouse and rat were homologous to human chromosome 11q . Fine genetic linkage mapping of the mouse AT region was performed using the interspecific backcross mice . Atm , Acat1 , and Npat , which is a new gene isolated from the AT region , and 12 flanking microsatellite DNA markers were examined . No recombinations were found among the Atm , Npat , Acat1 , and D9Mit6 loci , and these loci were mapped 2 . 0 cM distal to D9Mit99 and 1 . 3 cM proximal to D9Mit102 . Comparison of the linkage map of mouse chromosome 9 ( MMU9 ) and that of human chromosome 11 ( HSA11 ) indicates that there is a chromosomal rearrangement due to an inversion between Ets1 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 and that the inversion of MMU9 originated from the chromosomal breakage at the boundary between Gria4 and Atm-Npat-Acat1 on HSA11 . This type of inversion appeared to be conserved in the three rodent species , mouse , rat , and Syrian hamster , using additional comparative mapping data with the Rck gene",0,0,1,0
"Comparison of unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy findings in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease. A prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pallidotomy and subthalamotomy in advanced idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) refractory to medical treatment was designed. Ten consecutive patients (mean age, 58.4 +/- 6.8 years; 7 men, 3 women) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease (mean disease time, 8.4 +/- 3.5 years), disabling motor fluctuations (Hoehn _ Yahr stage 3-5 in off-drug phases) and levodopa-induced dyskinesias were selected. All patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analysed. Six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus interna (GPi) and four in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Clinical evaluation included the use of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Hoehn_Yahr score and Schwab England activities of daily living (ADL) score in 'on'- and 'off'-drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surgery. There was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 months. Levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the STN group. Changes in UPDRS, Hoehn _ Yahr and Schwab England ADL scores were similar in both groups. Cognitive functions were unchanged in both groups. Complications were observed in two patients: one had a left homonymous hemianopsia after pallidotomy and another one developed left hemiballistic movements 3 days after subthalamotomy which partly improved within 1 month with Valproate 1000 mg/day. The findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral STN and GPi are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced PD refractory to medical treatment.",0,0,1,0

"Acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin (adriamycin)-loaded cyanoacrylate nanoparticles. Acute doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticle (DXNP) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, 2/6 rats given free doxorubicin (DX) (5 mg/kg) died within one week, whereas all control animals and all rats having received free NP or DXNP survived. A 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with DXNP than in those treated with DX. Free NP did not provoke any proteinuria. Two hr post-injection, DXNP was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free DX (p < 0.025). In rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 rats given DX died within 7 days, in contrast to animals treated by DXNP, NP, or untreated, which all survived. Proteinuria appeared in all series, but was 2-5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), without significant difference between DXNP and DX. Rats treated by unloaded NP behaved as controls. These results demonstrate that, in these experimental conditions, DXNP killed less animals than free DX, despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the former. Both effects (better survival and nephrosis) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.",0,1,0,0

"A deletion mutation in COL17A1 in five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa represents propagation of an ancestral allele. Patients with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa , a usually nonlethal form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa , have generalized blistering , nail dystrophy , patchy alopecia , and dental abnormalities . Skin fragility in most cases is due to mutations in the gene encoding type XVII collagen ( COL17A1 ) . Recently , we reported five Austrian families with generalized atrophic benign epidermolysis bullosa who share the same COL17A1 mutation . Affected individuals in three families are homozygous for 4003delTC , whereas those in two others are compound heterozygotes . To determine if the occurrence of 4003delTC in these unrelated families signifies propagation of an ancestral allele or a mutational hot spot , haplotypes were determined for polymorphisms both within and flanking COL17A1 . Five intragenic polymorphisms were chosen based on their informativeness . One of these , not previously reported , was 2988 A or C that introduces a new restriction site for Eco0109 I . All the 4003delTC alleles showed the same haplotype for these five polymorphic markers . Fourteen microsatellite polymorphisms were selected based on their high heterozygosity and their location within 10q23-q25 near COL17A1 . Three families shared microsatellite polymorphisms covering at most 19 cM , whereas the others shared smaller regions consistent with cross-over events during passage of this mutation through several generations .

"A comparison of glyceryl trinitrate with diclofenac for the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea: an open, randomized, cross-over trial. Primary dysmenorrhea is a syndrome characterized by painful uterine contractility caused by a hypersecretion of endometrial prostaglandins; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first choice for its treatment. However, in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that myometrial cells are also targets of the relaxant effects of nitric oxide (NO). The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), an NO donor, in the resolution of primary dysmenorrhea in comparison with diclofenac (DCF). A total of 24 patients with the diagnosis of severe primary dysmenorrhea were studied during two consecutive menstrual cycles. In an open, cross-over, controlled design, patients were randomized to receive either DCF per os or GTN patches the first days of menses, when menstrual cramps became unendurable. In the subsequent cycle the other treatment was used. Patients received up to 3 doses/day of 50 mg DCF or 2.5 mg/24 h transdermal GTN for the first 3 days of the cycle, according to their needs. The participants recorded menstrual symptoms and possible side-effects at different times (0, 30, 60, 120 minutes) after the first dose of medication on the first day of the cycle, with both drugs. The difference in pain intensity score (DPI) was the main outcome variable. Both treatments significantly reduced DPI by the 30th minute (GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DCF, -18.9 +/- 16.6). However, DCF continued to be effective in reducing pelvic pain for two hours, whereas GTN scores remained more or less stable after 30 min and significantly higher than those for DFC (after one hour: GTN, -12.8 +/- 17.9; DFC, -18.9 +/- 16.6 and after two hours: GTN, -23.7 +/- 20.5; DFC, -59.7 +/- 17.9, p = 0.0001). Low back pain was also relieved by both drugs. Headache was significantly increased by GTN but not by DCF. Eight patients stopped using GTN because headache--attributed to its use--became intolerable. These findings indicate that GTN has a reduced efficacy and tolerability by comparison with DCF in the treatment of primary dysmenorrhea.",0,0,1,0
"Pharmacokinetics of desipramine HCl when administered with cinacalcet HCl. OBJECTIVE: In vitro work has demonstrated that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (CYP) 2D6. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cinacalcet on CYP2D6 activity, using desipramine as a probe substrate, in healthy subjects. METHODS: Seventeen subjects who were genotyped as CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers were enrolled in this randomized, open-label, crossover study to receive a single oral dose of desipramine (50 mg) on two separate occasions, once alone and once after multiple doses of cinacalcet (90 mg for 7 days). Blood samples were obtained predose and up to 72 h postdose. RESULTS: Fourteen subjects completed both treatment arms. Relative to desipramine alone, mean AUC and C(max) of desipramine increased 3.6- and 1.8-fold when coadministered with cinacalcet. The t (1/2,z) of desipramine was longer when desipramine was coadministered with cinacalcet (21.0 versus 43.3 hs). The t (max) was similar between the regimens. Fewer subjects reported adverse events following treatment with desipramine alone than when receiving desipramine with cinacalcet (33 versus 86%), the most frequent of which (nausea and headache) have been reported for patients treated with either desipramine or cinacalcet. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that cinacalcet is a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6. These data suggest that during concomitant treatment with cinacalcet, dose adjustment may be necessary for drugs that demonstrate a narrow therapeutic index and are metabolized by CYP2D6.",0,0,1,0
"Association of common genetic variants of HOMER1 gene with levodopa adverse effects in Parkinson's disease patients. Levodopa is the most effective symptomatic therapy for Parkinson's disease, but its chronic use could lead to chronic adverse outcomes, such as motor fluctuations, dyskinesia and visual hallucinations. HOMER1 is a protein with pivotal function in glutamate transmission, which has been related to the pathogenesis of these complications. This study investigates whether polymorphisms in the HOMER1 gene promoter region are associated with the occurrence of the chronic complications of levodopa therapy. A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were investigated. Patients were genotyped for rs4704559, rs10942891 and rs4704560 by allelic discrimination with Taqman assays.

Temporary hearing loss is a known toxicity of treatment with DFMO, thus a comprehensive approach was developed to analyze serial air conduction audiograms. The generalized estimating equation method estimated the mean difference between treatment arms with regard to change in air conduction pure tone thresholds while accounting for within-subject correlation due to repeated measurements at frequencies. Based on 290 subjects, there was an average difference of 0.50 dB between subjects treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo (95% confidence interval, -0.64 to 1.63 dB; P = 0.39), adjusted for baseline values, age, and frequencies. In the normal speech range of 500 to 3,000 Hz, an estimated difference of 0.99 dB (-0.17 to 2.14 dB; P = 0.09) was detected. Dose intensity did not add information to models. There were 14 of 151 (9.3%) in the DFMO plus sulindac group and 4 of 139 (2.9%) in the placebo group who experienced at least 15 dB hearing reduction from baseline in 2 or more consecutive frequencies across the entire range tested (P = 0.02). Follow-up air conduction done at least 6 months after end of treatment showed an adjusted mean difference in hearing thresholds of 1.08 dB (-0.81 to 2.96 dB; P = 0.26) between treatment arms. There was no significant difference in the proportion of subjects in the DFMO plus sulindac group who experienced clinically significant hearing loss compared with the placebo group. The estimated attributable risk of ototoxicity from exposure to the drug is 8.4% (95% confidence interval, -2.0% to 18.8%; P = 0.12). There is a <2 dB difference in mean threshold for patients treated with DFMO plus sulindac compared with those treated with placebo.",0,0,1,0
"Mitomycin C associated hemolytic uremic syndrome. Mitomycin C associated Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recognised. It consists of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin C treatment and affects about 10% of patients treated with this agent. The renal failure usually develops about 8-10 mth after start of mitomycin C treatment and the mortality is approximately 60% from renal failure or pulmonary edema. Renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic HUS and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi, expanded subendothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls, ischemic wrinkling of glomerular basement membranes and mesangiolysis. The mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin C-induced endothelial cell damage. We describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr-old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin C and died in pulmonary edema.",0,1,0,1

"Effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on hemostasis in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelet function is impaired by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with prominent anti-inflammatory properties. Their safety in patients undergoing intracranial surgery is under debate. Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were randomized to receive either ketoprofen, 100 mg, three times a day (ketoprofen group, n = 9) or a weak NSAID, acetaminophen, 1 g, three times a day (acetaminophen group, n = 9) starting immediately after the diagnosis of aneurysmal SAH. Treatment was continued for 3 days postoperatively. Test blood samples were taken before treatment and surgery as well as on the first, third, and fifth postoperative mornings. Maximal platelet aggregation induced by 6 microM of adenosine diphosphate decreased after administration of ketoprofen. Aggregation was lower (P < .05) in the ketoprofen group than in the acetaminophen group just before surgery and on the third postoperative day. In contrast, maximal platelet aggregation increased in the acetaminophen group on the third postoperative day as compared with the pretreatment platelet aggregation results (P < .05). One patient in the ketoprofen group developed a postoperative intracranial hematoma. Coagulation (prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [APPT], fibrinogen concentration, and antithrombin III [AT III]) was comparable between the two groups. Ketoprofen but not acetaminophen impaired platelet function in patients with SAH. If ketoprofen is used before surgery on cerebral artery aneurysms, it may pose an additional risk factor for hemorrhage.",1,0,1,0
"Detailed spectral profile analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in anesthetized rats. Penicillin model is a widely used experimental model for epilepsy research. In the present study we aimed to portray a detailed spectral analysis of penicillin-induced epileptiform activity in comparison with basal brain activity in anesthetized Wistar rats. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized with i.p. urethane and connected to an electrocorticogram setup. After a short period of basal activity recording, epileptic focus was induced by injecting 400IU/2 microl penicillin-G potassium into the left lateral ventricle while the cortical activity was continuously recorded. Basal activity, latent period and the penicillin-induced epileptiform activity periods were then analyzed using both conventional methods and spectral analysis. Spectral analyses were conducted by dividing the whole spectrum into different frequency bands including delta, theta (slow and fast), alpha-sigma, beta (1 and 2) and gamma (1 and 2) bands. Our results show that the most affected frequency bands were delta, theta, beta-2 and gamma-2 bands during the epileptiform activity and there were marked differences in terms of spectral densities between three investigated episodes (basal activity, latent period and epileptiform activity). Our results may help to analyze novel data obtained using similar experimental models and the simple analysis method described here can be used in similar studies to investigate the basic neuronal mechanism of this or other types of experimental epilepsies.",1,0,1,0
"The tumor suppressor gene Brca1 is required for embryonic cellular proliferation in the mouse. Mutations of the BRCA1 gone in humans are associated with predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers .

The expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is dramatically increased in the mutant embryos . Buttressing these in vivo observations is the fact that mutant blastocyst growth is grossly impaired in vitro . Thus , the death of Brca1 ( 5-6 ) mutant embryos prior to gastrulation may be due to a failure of the proliferative burst required for the development of the different germ layers .",0,0,0,1
"Cocaine, ethanol, and cocaethylene cardiotoxity in an animal model of cocaine and ethanol abuse. OBJECTIVES: Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually. In combination, these substances are substantially more toxic than either drug alone. Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug; however, they may also be due to cocaethylene (CE), a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol. The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of CE in the combined cardiotoxicity of cocaine and ethanol in a model simulating their abuse. METHODS: Twenty-three dogs were randomized to receive either 1) three intravenous (IV) boluses of cocaine 7.5 mg/kg with ethanol (1 g/kg) as an IV infusion (C+E, n = 8), 2) three cocaine boluses only (C, n = 6), 3) ethanol infusion only (E, n = 5), or 4) placebo boluses and infusion (n = 4). Hemodynamic measurements, electrocardiograms, and serum drug concentrations were obtained at baseline, and then at fixed time intervals after each drug was administered. RESULTS: Two of eight dogs in the C+E group experienced cardiovascular collapse. The most dramatic hemodynamic changes occurred after each cocaine bolus in the C+E and C only groups; however, persistent hemodynamic changes occurred in the C+E group. Peak CE levels were associated with a 45% (SD +/- 22%, 95% CI = 22% to 69%) decrease in cardiac output (p < 0.05), a 56% (SD +/- 23%, 95% CI = 32% to 80%) decrease in dP/dt(max) (p <.006), and a 23% (SD +/- 15%, 95% CI = 7% to 49%) decrease in SVO(2) (p < 0.025). Ventricular arrhythmias were primarily observed in the C+E group, in which four of eight dogs experienced ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS: Cocaine and ethanol in combination were more toxic than either substance alone. Co-administration resulted in prolonged cardiac toxicity and was dysrhythmogenic. Peak serum cocaethylene concentrations were associated with prolonged myocardial depression.",1,0,1,0

"Associations between use of benzodiazepines or related drugs and health, physical abilities and cognitive function: a non-randomised clinical study in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To describe associations between the use of benzodiazepines or related drugs (BZDs/RDs) and health, functional abilities and cognitive function in the elderly. METHODS: A non-randomised clinical study of patients aged > or =65 years admitted to acute hospital wards during 1 month. 164 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation [SD] 81.6 +/- 6.8 years) were admitted. Of these, nearly half (n = 78) had used BZDs/RDs before admission, and the remainder (n = 86) were non-users. Cognitive ability was assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Patients scoring > or =20 MMSE sum points were interviewed (n = 79) and questioned regarding symptoms and functional abilities during the week prior to admission. Data on use of BZDs/RDs before admission, current medications and discharge diagnoses were collected from medical records. Health, physical abilities and cognitive function were compared between BZD/RD users and non-users, and adjustments were made for confounding variables. The residual serum concentrations of oxazepam, temazepam and zopiclone were analysed. RESULTS: The mean +/- SD duration of BZD/RD use was 7 +/- 7 years (range 1-31). Two or three BZDs/RDs were concomitantly taken by 26% of users (n = 20). Long-term use of these drugs was associated with female sex and use of a higher number of drugs with effects on the CNS, which tended to be related to diagnosed dementia. After adjustment for these variables as confounders, use of BZDs/RDs was not associated with cognitive function as measured by the MMSE. However, use of BZDs/RDs was associated with dizziness, inability to sleep after awaking at night and tiredness in the mornings during the week prior to admission and with stronger depressive symptoms measured at the beginning of the hospital stay. Use of BZDs/RDs tended to be associated with a reduced ability to walk and shorter night-time sleep during the week prior to admission. A higher residual serum concentration of temazepam correlated with a lower MMSE sum score after adjustment for confounding variables. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term use and concomitant use of more than one BZD/RD were common in elderly patients hospitalised because of acute illnesses. Long-term use was associated with daytime and night-time symptoms indicative of poorer health and potentially caused by the adverse effects of these drugs.",0,0,1,0

"Are Dp71 and Dp140 brain dystrophin isoforms related to cognitive impairment in Duchenne muscular dystrophy?. Molecular study and neuropsychological analysis were performed concurrently on 49 patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) in order to find a molecular explanation for the cognitive impairment observed in most DMD patients . Complete analysis of the dystrophin gene was performed to define the localization of deletions and duplications in relation to the different DMD promoters . Qualitative analysis of the Dp71 transcript and testing for the specific first exon of Dp140 were also carried out . Neuropsychological analysis assessed verbal and visuospatial intelligence , verbal memory , and reading skills . Comparison of molecular and psychometric findings demonstrated that deletions and duplications that were localized in the distal part of the gene seemed to be preferentially associated with cognitive impairment . Two altered Dp71 transcripts and two deleted Dp140 DNA sequences were found in four patients with severe cerebral dysfunction . These findings suggest that some sequences located in the distal part of the gene and , in particular , some DMD isoforms expressed in the brain may be related to the cognitive impairment associated with DMD . .",0,0,1,0
"Ketamine in war/tropical surgery (a final tribute to the racemic mixture). A technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including caesarian sections and interventions in neonates. Operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air/oxygen only. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate and local anaesthesia, and induction with standard doses of ketamine, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved safe and effective. Emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring, relying heavily on the heart rate. Diazepam, unless contraindicated or risky, remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analgesia. An antisialogue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h, glycopyrrolate being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially in a hot climate. Experience in war/tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life-saving emergency surgery or in mass casualties where, e.g. amputation and rapid extrication were required.",1,0,0,0

"Topical 0.025% capsaicin in chronic post-herpetic neuralgia: efficacy, predictors of response and long-term course. In order to evaluate the efficacy, time-course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin, 39 patients with chronic post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), median duration 24 months, were treated with 0.025% capsaicin cream for 8 weeks. During therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and a verbal outcome scale. A follow-up investigation was performed 10-12 months after study onset on the patients who had improved. Nineteen patients (48.7%) substantially improved after the 8-week trial; 5 (12.8%) discontinued therapy due to side-effects such as intolerable capsaicin-induced burning sensations (4) or mastitis (1); 15 (38.5%) reported no benefit. The decrease in VAS ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous application. Of the responders 72.2% were still improved at the follow-up; only one-third of them had continued application irregularly. Treatment effect was not dependent on patient's age, duration or localization of PHN (trigeminal involvement was excluded), sensory disturbance or pain character. Treatment response was not correlated with the incidence, time-course or severity of capsaicin-induced burning. If confirmed in controlled trials, the long-term results of this open, non-randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in PHN is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes (perhaps degeneration) of nociceptive afferents.",0,0,1,0
Linezolid-induced optic neuropathy. Many systemic antimicrobials have been implicated to cause ocular adverse effects. This is especially relevant in multidrug therapy where more than one drug can cause a similar ocular adverse effect. We describe a case of progressive loss of vision associated with linezolid therapy. A 45-year-old male patient who was on treatment with multiple second-line anti-tuberculous drugs including linezolid and ethambutol for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) presented to us with painless progressive loss of vision in both eyes. Color vision was defective and fundus examination revealed optic disc edema in both eyes. Ethambutol-induced toxic optic neuropathy was suspected and tablet ethambutol was withdrawn. Deterioration of vision occurred despite withdrawal of ethambutol. Discontinuation of linezolid resulted in marked improvement of vision. Our report emphasizes the need for monitoring of visual function in patients on long-term linezolid treatment.,0,0,1,0

"Flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate (MSG): evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits. These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of MSG produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility, since previous investigations were inconclusive. A flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG (4 mg/g and 1 mg/g). MSG treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold. A naloxone (5 mg/kg) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of MSG-treated mice. Flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure; however, the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear. Flurothyl seizure testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate seizure susceptibility.",0,0,1,0
"Effect of alpha-tocopherol and deferoxamine on methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity. Methamphetamine (MA)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity is believed to be associated with the increased formation of free radicals. This study examined the effect of alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TC), a scavenger of reactive oxygen species, and deferoxamine (DFO), an iron chelator, on the MA-induced neurotoxicity. Male rats were treated with MA (10 mg/kg, every 2 h for four injections). The rat received either alpha-TC (20 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 3 days and 30 min prior to MA administration or DFO (50 mg/kg) subcutaneously 30 min before MA administration. The concentrations of dopamine (DA), serotonin and their metabolites decreased significantly after MA administration, which was inhibited by the alpha-TC and DFO pretreatment. alpha-TC and DFO attenuated the MA-induced hyperthermia as well as the alterations in the locomotor activity. The level of lipid peroxidation was higher and the reduced glutathione concentration was lower in the MA-treated rats. These changes were significantly attenuated by alpha-TC and DFO. This suggests that alpha-TC and DFO ameliorate the MA-induced neuronal damage by decreasing the level of oxidative stress.",0,0,1,0

"Alpha-lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuropathy. The study investigates if alpha-lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity, if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade, and if neuroprotective effects of alpha-lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protection. We used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin, two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic drugs. This approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha-lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha-lipoic acid. Our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neurons. Alpha-lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons: it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of frataxin, an essential mitochondrial protein with anti-oxidant and chaperone properties. In conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neurotoxicity. Alpha-lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti-oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions, possibly inducing the expression of frataxin. These findings suggest that alpha-lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials.",0,0,1,0

Deletions of a DNA sequence in retinoblastomas and mesenchymal tumors: organization of the sequence and its encoded protein. Retinoblastoma is a childhood tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations . The mutant allele can be carried in the germ line . The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a recessive oncogene located within band q14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB1 locus . We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB1 locus . We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma . These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis . Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role . .,0,0,0,1

"Linkage relationships of the apolipoprotein C1 gene and a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP2A) to myotonic dystrophy. We have studied the genetic linkage of two markers , the apolipoprotein C1 ( APOC1 ) gene and a cytochrome P450 ( CYP2A ) gene , in relation to the gene for myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . A peak lod score of 9 . 29 at 2 cM was observed for APOC1-DM , with a lod score of 8 . 55 at 4 cM for CYP2A-DM . These two markers also show close linkage to each other ( theta max = 0 . 05 , Zmax = 9 . 09 ) . From examination of the genotypes of the recombinant individuals , CYP2A appears to map proximal to DM because in one recombinant individual CYP2A , APOC2 and CKMM had all recombined with DM .

"Myotonic dystrophy protein kinase is involved in the modulation of the Ca2+ homeostasis in skeletal muscle cells. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , the most prevalent muscular disorder in adults , is caused by ( CTG ) n-repeat expansion in a gene encoding a protein kinase ( DM protein kinase ; DMPK ) and involves changes in cytoarchitecture and ion homeostasis . To obtain clues to the normal biological role of DMPK in cellular ion homeostasis , we have compared the resting [ Ca2 + ] i , the amplitude and shape of depolarization-induced Ca2 + transients , and the content of ATP-driven ion pumps in cultured skeletal muscle cells of wild-type and DMPK [ - / - ] knockout mice . In vitro-differentiated DMPK [ - / - ] myotubes exhibit a higher resting [ Ca2 + ] i than do wild-type myotubes because of an altered open probability of voltage-dependent l-type Ca2 + and Na + channels . The mutant myotubes exhibit smaller and slower Ca2 + responses upon triggering by acetylcholine or high external K + . In addition , we observed that these Ca2 + transients partially result from an influx of extracellular Ca2 + through the l-type Ca2 + channel . Neither the content nor the activity of Na + / K + ATPase and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + -ATPase are affected by DMPK absence . In conclusion , our data suggest that DMPK is involved in modulating the initial events of excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle . .",0,0,1,0

"Anticipation resulting in elimination of the myotonic dystrophy gene: a follow up study of one extended family. We have re-examined an extended myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) family , previously described in 1955 , in order to study the long term effects of anticipation in DM and in particular the implications for families affected by this disease . This follow up study provides data on 35 gene carriers and 46 asymptomatic at risk family members in five generations . Clinical anticipation , defined as the cascade of mild , adult , childhood , or congenital disease in subsequent generations , appeared to be a relentless process , occurring in all affected branches of the family . The cascade was found to proceed asynchronously in the different branches , mainly because of an unequal number of generations with mild disease . The transition from the mild to the adult type was associated with transmission through a male parent . Stable transmission of the asymptomatic / mild phenotype showed a female transmission bias . We further examined the extent and causes of gene loss in this pedigree . Gene loss in the patient group was complete , owing to infertility of the male patients with adult onset disease and the fact that mentally retarded patients did not procreate . Out of the 46 at risk subjects in the two youngest generations , only one was found to have a full mutation . This is the only subject who may transmit the gene to the sixth generation . No protomutation carriers were found in the fourth and fifth generations . Therefore it is highly probable that the DM gene will be eliminated from this pedigree within one generation . The high population frequency of DM can at present not be explained by the contribution of asymptomatic cases in the younger generations of known families , but is probably caused by the events in the ancestral generations . .",0,0,1,0

"The enhancement of aminonucleoside nephrosis by the co-administration of protamine. An experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin-aminonucleoside (AMNS) and protamine sulfate (PS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, uninephrectomized three weeks before, received daily injections of subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body wt) and intravenous PS (2 separated doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body wt) for four days. The series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day intervals. The animals were sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. They developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal failure. The time-course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference (P less than 0.01) from that of each control group, such as, AMNS alone, PS alone or saline injected. Their glomeruli showed changes of progressive FSGS. The ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina rara externa and marked changes in epithelial cell cytoplasm. Therefore, it is suggested that the administration of PS enhances the toxicity of AMNS on the glomerulus and readily produces progressive FSGS in rats resulting in the end-stage renal disease.",0,1,0,0
"Methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling. Methamphetamine (METH) damages dopamine (DA) nerve endings by a process that has been linked to microglial activation but the signaling pathways that mediate this response have not yet been delineated. Cardona et al. [Nat. Neurosci. 9 (2006), 917] recently identified the microglial-specific fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) as an important mediator of MPTP-induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons. Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity, we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH-induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation. Mice in which the CX3CR1 gene has been deleted and replaced with a cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) were treated with METH and examined for striatal neurotoxicity. METH depleted DA, caused microglial activation, and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild-type controls. The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender-dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum. Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation. This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP-microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH. We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation. Furthermore, it appears that striatal-resident microglia respond to METH with an activation cascade and then return to a surveying state without undergoing apoptosis or migration.",0,0,1,0

"Deficiency of the murine fifth complement component (C5) . A 2-base pair gene deletion in a 5'-exon. To ascertain the molecular mechanism that causes murine C5 deficiency , genomic and cDNA libraries were constructed from mouse liver DNA and mRNA employing the congenic strains B10 . D2 / nSnJ and B10 . D2 / oSnJ that are sufficient and deficient for C5 , respectively . Genomic fragments were isolated which correspond to PvuII and HindIII restriction fragment length polymorphisms associated with C5 deficiency . Sequence analyses demonstrated that each of these polymorphisms resulted from single base pair substitutions and that neither substitution would probably cause or contribute to the C5 deficiency . Sequence analyses of C5 sufficient and deficient cDNAs revealed a 2 base-pair deletion in the deficient cDNAs . The "" TA "" deletion was located near the 5 end of the cDNA . This deletion shifts the reading frame of the C5 mRNA so that the termination codon UGA is present 4 base pairs downstream from the deletion . Genomic DNA was amplified and sequenced corresponding to the area surrounding the 2-base pair deletion . Six C5-deficient strains , A / HeJ , AKR / J , DBA / 2J , NZB / B1NJ , SWR / J , and B10 .

The sequencing data revealed that the 2 base pairs were deleted from the C5 gene of each deficient mouse tested but not from the C5 gene of any sufficient mouse . These data demonstrate that  1 ) there is an identical 2-base pair deletion in an exon of the C5 gene in several different C5-deficient mouse strains ; 2 ) the mRNA transcribed from the C5D gene retains this deletion ; and 3 ) this mutation should result in C5 protein deficiency .",0,1,1,0
"HLA B27 and the genetics of ankylosing spondylitis. One hundred and twenty-eight of 145 patients with ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) were found to be HLA B27 positive . Five patients had evidence of a sero-negative peripheral arthritis resembling peripheral psoriatic arthritis and 3 of these were B27 negative . One further B27 negative patients had a sister with ankylosing spondylitis and ulcerative colitis and a mother with ulcerative colitis . There was evidence of a somewhat later age of onset of symptoms in B27 negative patients . These findings are interpreted as suggesting some degree of clinical and genetic heterogeneity in ankylosing spondylitis with genes for psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease being important in some individuals , particularly those who are B27 negative . Twenty-five first-degree relatives with ankylosing spondylitis were all B27 positive . The only instance of disassociation of B27 and spondylitis in a family was where the proband had ulcerative colitis as well as spondylitis . Of 13 B27 positive fathers 3 could be diagnosed as having definite ankylosing spondylitis ( 23 % ) . These findings are thought to provide evidence against the concept that the gene for ankylosing spondylitis is not B27 but a closely linked gene and favour the occurrence of an environmental event affecting approximately one-fifth of B27 positive males to result in disease . .",0,0,1,0
"Structure-activity and dose-effect relationships of the antagonism of picrotoxin-induced seizures by cholecystokinin, fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mice. Intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester (CCK-8-SE) and nonsulphated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8-NS) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picrotoxin in mice. Experiments with N- and C-terminal fragments revealed that the C-terminal tetrapeptide (CCK-5-8) was the active centre of the CCK octapeptide molecule. The analogues CCK-8-SE and CCK-8-NS (dose range 0.2-6.4 mumol/kg) and caerulein dose range 0.1-0.8 mumol/kg) showed bell-shaped dose-effect curves, with the greatest maximum inhibition for CCK-8-NS. The peptide CCK-5-8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the octapeptides, 3.2 mumol/kg and larger doses of the reference drug, diazepam, totally prevented picrotoxin-induced seizures and mortality. The maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of diazepam. Experiments with analogues and derivatives of CCK-5-8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta-alanyl derivatives of CCK-5-8 were enhanced and that they were equipotent with CCK-8-SE.

"Metallothionein induction reduces caspase-3 activity and TNFalpha levels with preservation of cognitive function and intact hippocampal neurons in carmustine-treated rats. Hippocampal integrity is essential for cognitive functions. On the other hand, induction of metallothionein (MT) by ZnSO(4) and its role in neuroprotection has been documented. The present study aimed to explore the effect of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in rats. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into four groups (15/group): The control group injected with single doses of normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 h later by BCNU solvent (i.v). The second group administered ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v, once) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 h. Third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 h after injection with normal saline (i.c.v). Fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO(4) (0.1 micromol/10 microl normal saline, i.c.v) then BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 h. The obtained data revealed that BCNU administration resulted in deterioration of learning and short-term memory (STM), as measured by using radial arm water maze, accompanied with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Also, BCNU administration increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents as well as caspase-3 activity in addition to histological alterations. ZnSO(4) pretreatment counteracted BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH and resulted in significant reduction in the levels of MDA and TNFalpha as well as the activity of caspase-3. The histological features were improved in hippocampus of rats treated with ZnSO(4) + BCNU compared to only BCNU-treated animals. In conclusion, MT induction halts BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity as it prevented GR inhibition and GSH depletion and counteracted the increased levels of TNFalpha, MDA and caspase-3 activity with subsequent preservation of cognition.",0,0,1,1

"Assessment of perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention in New Hampshire delivery hospitals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate current performance on recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention practices in New Hampshire. METHODS: Data were extracted from 2021 paired mother-infant records for the year 2000 birth cohort in New Hampshire's 25 delivery hospitals. Assessment was done on the following: prenatal screening for hepatitis B and rubella, administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, administration of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity, and administration of in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine to rubella nonimmune women. RESULTS: Prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%) were high. Hepatitis B vaccine birth dose was administered to 76.2% of all infants. All infants who were born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers also received hepatitis B immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression showed that the month of delivery and infant birth weight were independent predictors of hepatitis B vaccination. The proportion of infants who were vaccinated in January and February 2000 (48.5% and 67.5%, respectively) was less than any other months, whereas the proportion who were vaccinated in December 2000 (88.2%) was the highest. Women who were born between 1971 and 1975 had the highest rate of rubella nonimmunity (9.5%). In-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine administration was documented for 75.6% of nonimmune women.

"Detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy with iodine-125-metaiodobenzylguanidine. Radiolabeled metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), an analog of norepinephrine (NE), serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function. Using a rat model of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy, we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose-dependently in adriamycin cardiomyopathy. The degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment (2 mg/kg, once a week). There were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2-wk treatment groups, isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3-wk group, frequent scattered degeneration in the 4-wk group, scattered or focal degeneration in the 5-wk group, and extensive degeneration in the 8-wk group. Myocardial accumulation of [125I]MIBG 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less. However, the 4-wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall (82% of the control) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall (about 66% of the control: p less than 0.05). In the 5-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35% and 27% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). In the 8-wk group, MIBG accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18% and 14% of that in controls, respectively (p less than 0.001). Thus, MIBG accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose-dependent manner. The appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment (scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration) indicates that MIBG scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin-induced cardiomyopathy.",1,0,1,0
"Vasopressin in the treatment of milrinone-induced hypotension in severe heart failure. The use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as milrinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypotension. In patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with milrinone, low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of milrinone.",1,0,0,0
"Dual roles of ATM in the cellular response to radiation and in cell growth control. The gene mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) patients , denoted ATM , encodes a putative protein or lipid kinase . To elucidate the functions of ATM , we disrupted the mouse ATM gene through homologous recombination in mice . Consistent with cellular defects of AT patients , the ATM- / - cells are hypersensitive to gamma-irradiation and defective in cell-cycle arrest following radiation , correlating with a defective up-regulation of p53 . In addition , ATM- / - mouse thymocytes are more resistant to apoptosis induced by gamma-irradiation than normal thymocytes . ATM- / - fibroblasts are inefficient in G1 to S-phase progression following serum stimulation and senesce after only a few passages in culture . They have an increased constitutive level of p21CP1 / WAF1 . The ATM protein is therefore critical both for cellular responses to ionizing radiation and for normal cell-cycle progression . ATM + / - fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediately defective responses to irradiation but no growth defect , suggesting that the increased cancer risk of AT heterozygotes could be attributable to poor checkpoint function . .",0,0,1,1

"Expression of the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor gene during human embryogenesis. The von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease product is thought to down-regulate transcription by antagonizing elongin-enhanced transcriptional elongation . Germline VHL gene mutations predispose to the development of retinal , cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastomas , renal cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma . In addition , somatic Inactivation of the VHL gene is frequent in sporadic renal cell carcinoma and haemangioblastoma . Regulation of transcript elongation is an important control mechanism for gene expression and the VHL gene might modify the expression of proto-oncogenes and growth suppressor genes during embryogenesis . We therefore investigated the expression of VHL mRNA during human embryogenesis by in situ hybridization studies at 4 , 6 and 10 weeks post conception . Although VHL mRNA was expressed in all three germ layers , strong expression was noted in the central nervous system , kidneys , testis and lung . Within the kidney , VHL mRNA was differentially expressed within renal tubules suggesting that the VHL gene product may have a specific role in kidney development . Two alternatively spliced VHL mRNAs characterized by inclusion ( isoform I ) or exclusion ( isoform II ) of exon 2 are transcribed in adult tissues . To investigate if the two isoforms are differentially expressed during embryogenesis , VHL mRNA was reverse transcribed from 13 fetal tissues ( 8-10 weeks gestation ) . The quantitative distribution of VHL mRNA within fetal tissues reflected that seen by in situ hybridization and the ratio of the two VHL isoforms was similar between tissues . Although the genes regulated by the VHL gene product have not yet been identified , our findings are compatible with the hypothesis that VHL-mediated control of transcriptional elongation may have a role in normal human development . .",0,1,1,1
"Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations in a juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient. Fragments of the arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) gene from a patient with juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) were amplified by PCR and ligated into MP13 cloning vectors . Clones hybridizing with cDNA for human ARSA were selected , examined for appropriate size inserts , and used to prepare single-stranded phage DNA . Examination of the entire coding and most of the intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations . One , a point mutation in exon 3 , resulted in the substitution of isoleucine by serine . Introduction of this alteration into the normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted in a substantial decrease in ARSA activity on transient expression in cultured baby hamster kidney cells . About 5 % of the control expression was observed , suggesting a small residual activity in the mutated ARSA . The second mutation , a G-to-A transition , occurred in the other allele and resulted in an altered splice-recognition sequence between exon 7 and the following intron . The mutation also resulted in the loss of a restriction site . Apparently normal levels of mRNA were generated from this allele , but no ARSA activity or immuno-cross-reactive material could be detected . A collection of DNA samples from known or suspected MLD patients , members of their families , and normal controls was screened for these mutations . Four additional individuals carrying each of the mutations were found among the nearly 100 MLD patients in the sample . Gene segregation in the original patients family was consistent with available clinical and biochemical data . No individuals homozygous for either of these two mutations were identified . However , combinations with other MLD mutations suggest that the point mutation in exon 3 does result in some residual enzyme activity and is associated with late-onset forms of the disease . The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD when combined with other enzyme-null mutations , implying that it is completely silent enzymatically . .",0,1,1,0
"Acute neurologic dysfunction after high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma. Etoposide (VP-16-213) has been used in the treatment of many solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. When used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation, this agent has activity against several treatment-resistant cancers including malignant glioma. In six of eight patients (75%) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma, sudden severe neurologic deterioration occurred. This developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high-dose etoposide therapy. Significant clinical manifestations have included confusion, papilledema, somnolence, exacerbation of motor deficits, and sharp increase in seizure activity. These abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high-dose intravenous dexamethasone therapy. In all patients, computerized tomographic (CT) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and peritumor edema when compared with pretransplant scans. This complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high-dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma.",0,0,1,1

"Low levels of beta hexosaminidase A in healthy individuals with apparent deficiency of this enzyme. Appreciable beta hexosaminidase A ( hex A ) activity has been detected in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue from healthy individuals previously reported as having deficiency of hex A activity indistinguishable from that of patients with Tay-Sachs disease ( TSD ) . Identification and quantitation of hex A , amounting to 3 . 5 % -6 . 9 % of total beta hexosaminidase activity , has been obtained by cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis , DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography , radial immunodiffusion , and radioimmunoassay . Previous family studies suggested that these individuals may be compound heterozygotes for the common mutant TSD gene and a rare ( allelic ) mutant gene . Thus , the postulated rate mutant gene appears to code for the expression of low amounts of hex A . Heterozygotes for the rare mutant may be indistinguishable from heterozygotes for the common TSD mutant . However , direct visualization and quantitation of hex A by the methods described may prevent false-positive prenatal diagnosis of TSD in fetuses having the incomplete hex A deficiency of the type described in the four healthy individuals",0,0,0,1
"Seizures associated with levofloxacin: case presentation and literature review. PURPOSE: We present a case of a patient who developed seizures shortly after initiating treatment with levofloxacin and to discuss the potential drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 in this case, as well as in other cases, of levofloxacin-induced seizures. METHODS: Several biomedical databases were searched including MEDLINE, Cochrane and Ovid. The main search terms utilized were case report and levofloxacin. The search was limited to studies published in English. RESULTS: Six cases of levofloxacin-induced seizures have been reported in the literature. Drug-drug interactions related to the inhibition of CYP1A2 by levofloxacin are likely involved in the clinical outcome of these cases.

"Cloning of the Huntington disease region in yeast artificial chromosomes. The gene responsible for Huntington disease has been localized to a 2 . 5 million base pair ( Mb ) region between the loci D4S10 and D4S168 on the short arm of chromosome 4 . As part of a strategy to clone the HD gene on the basis of its chromosomal location , we isolated genomic DNA from the HD region as a set of overlapping yeast artificial chromosome ( YAC ) clones . Twenty-eight YAC clones were identified by screening human YAC libraries with twelve PCR-based sequence-tagged sites ( STSs ) from the region . We assembled the YAC clones into overlapping sets by hybridizing them to a large number of DNA probes from the HD region , including the STSs . In addition , we isolated the ends of the human DNA inserts of most of the YAC clones to assist in the construction of the contig . Although almost half of the YACs appear to contain chimeric inserts and several contain internal deletions or other rearrangements , we were able to obtain over 2 . 2 Mb of the HD region in YACs , including one continuous segment of 2 . 0 Mb covering the region that most likely contains the HD gene . Ten of the twenty eight YAC clones comprise a minimal set spanning the 2 . 2 Mb . These clones provide reagents for the complete characterization of this region of the genome and for the eventual isolation of the HD gene .",0,0,1,0
"Development of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in parkinsonian monkeys may depend upon rate of symptom onset and/or duration of symptoms. Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LIDs) present a major problem for the long-term management of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Due to the interdependence of risk factors in clinical populations, it is difficult to independently examine factors that may influence the development of LIDs. Using macaque monkeys with different types of MPTP-induced parkinsonism, the current study evaluated the degree to which rate of symptom progression, symptom severity, and response to and duration of levodopa therapy may be involved in the development of LIDs. Monkeys with acute (short-term) MPTP exposure, rapid symptom onset and short symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy developed dyskinesia between 11 and 24 days of daily levodopa administration. In contrast, monkeys with long-term MPTP exposure, slow symptom progression and/or long symptom duration prior to initiation of levodopa therapy were more resistant to developing LIDs (e.g., dyskinesia developed no sooner than 146 days of chronic levodopa administration). All animals were similarly symptomatic at the start of levodopa treatment and had similar therapeutic responses to the drug. These data suggest distinct differences in the propensity to develop LIDs in monkeys with different rates of symptom progression or symptom durations prior to levodopa and demonstrate the value of these models for further studying the pathophysiology of LIDs.",0,0,1,0
"The DNA double-strand break repair gene hMRE11 is mutated in individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder. We show that hypomorphic mutations in hMRE11 , but not in ATM , are present in certain individuals with an ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder ( ATLD ) . The cellular features resulting from these hMRE11 mutations are similar to those seen in A-T as well as NBS and include hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation , radioresistant DNA synthesis , and abrogation of ATM-dependent events , such as the activation of Jun kinase following exposure to gamma irradiation . Although the mutant hMre11 proteins retain some ability to interact with hRad50 and Nbs1 , formation of ionizing radiation-induced hMre11 and Nbs1 foci was absent in hMRE11 mutant cells . These data demonstrate that ATM and the hMre11 / hRad50 / Nbs1 protein complex act in the same DNA damage response pathway and link hMre11 to the complex pathology of A-T . .",0,0,1,0
"Preservation of renal blood flow during hypotension induced with fenoldopam in dogs. The introduction of drugs that could induce hypotension with different pharmacological actions would be advantageous because side effects unique to a specific drug could be minimized by selecting appropriate therapy. Specific dopamine-1, (DA1) and dopamine-2 (DA2) receptor agonists are now under clinical investigation. Fenoldopam mesylate is a specific DA1 receptor agonist that lowers blood pressure by vasodilatation. The hypothesis that fenoldopam could be used to induce hypotension and preserve blood flow to the kidney was tested. Systemic aortic blood pressure and renal blood flow were measured continuously with a carotid arterial catheter and an electromagnetic flow probe respectively, in order to compare the cardiovascular and renal vascular effects of fenoldopam and sodium nitroprusside in ten dogs under halothane general anaesthesia. Mean arterial pressure was decreased 30 +/- 8 per cent from control with infusion of fenoldopam (3.4 +/- 2.0 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) and 34 +/- 4 per cent with infusion of sodium nitroprusside (5.9 micrograms.kg-1.min-1) (NS). Renal blood flow (RBF) increased during fenoldopam-induced hypotension 11 +/- 7 per cent and decreased 21 +/- 8 per cent during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension (P less than 0.01). Sodium nitroprusside is a non-selective arteriolar and venous vasodilator that can produce redistribution of blood flow away from the kidney during induced hypotension. Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine-1 (DA1) receptor agonist that causes vasodilatation to the kidney and other organs with DA1 receptors and preserves blood flow to the kidney during induced hypotension.",1,1,1,0

"Increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused by a common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation. BACKGROUND AND METHODS . The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein ( CETP ) catalyzes the transfer of cholesteryl esters from high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) to other lipoproteins . We recently described a Japanese family with increased HDL levels and CETP deficiency due to a splicing defect of the CETP gene . To assess the frequency and phenotype of this condition , we screened 11 additional families with high HDL levels by means of a radioimmunoassay for CETP and DNA analysis . RESULTS . We found the same CETP gene mutation in four families from three different regions of Japan . Analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms of the mutant CETP allele showed that all probands were homozygous for the identical haplotype . Family members homozygous for CETP deficiency ( n = 10 ) had moderate hypercholesterolemia ( mean total cholesterol level [ + / - SD ] , 7 . 01 + / - 0 . 83 mmol per liter ) , markedly increased levels of HDL cholesterol ( 4 . 24 + / - 1 . 01 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein A-I , and decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( 1 . 99 + / - 0 . 80 mmol per liter ) and apolipoprotein B . Members heterozygous for the deficiency ( n = 20 ) , whose CETP levels were in the lower part of the normal range , had moderately increased levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and an increased ratio of HDL subclass 2 to HDL subclass 3 , as compared with unaffected family members ( 1 . 5 + / - 0 . 8 vs . 0 . 7 + / - 0 . 4 ) . CETP deficiency was not found in six unrelated subjects with elevated HDL cholesterol levels who were from different parts of the United States . CONCLUSIONS . CETP deficiency appears to be a frequent cause of increased HDL levels in the population of Japan , possibly because of a founder effect . The results that we observed in heterozygotes suggest that CETP normally plays a part in the regulation of levels of HDL subclass 2 . There was no evidence of premature atherosclerosis in the families with CETP deficiency . In fact , the lipoprotein profile of persons with CETP deficiency is potentially antiatherogenic and may be associated with an increased life span .",0,0,1,0
"Utility of troponin I in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Baseline electrocardiogram abnormalities and market elevations not associated with myocardial necrosis make accurate diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI) difficult in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. Troponin sampling may offer greater diagnostic utility in these patients. OBJECTIVE: To assess outcomes based on troponin positivity in patients with cocaine chest pain admitted for exclusion of MI. METHODS: Outcomes were examined in patients admitted for possible MI after cocaine use. All patients underwent a rapid rule-in protocol that included serial sampling of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over eight hours. Outcomes included CK-MB MI (CK-MB >or= 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] >or= 4, cardiac death, and significant coronary disease (>or=50%). RESULTS: Of the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) met CK-MB criteria for MI and 38 (16%) had cTnI elevations. Angiography was performed in 29 of 38 patients who were cTnI-positive, with significant disease present in 25 (86%). Three of the four patients without significant disease who had cTnI elevations met CK-MB criteria for MI, and the other had a peak CK-MB level of 13 ng/mL. Sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative likelihood ratios for predicting cardiac death or significant disease were high for both CK-MB MI and cTnI and were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with cTnI elevations meet CK-MB criteria for MI, as well as have a high incidence of underlying significant disease. Troponin appears to have an equivalent diagnostic accuracy compared with CK-MB for diagnosing necrosis in patients with cocaine-associated chest pain and suspected MI.",1,0,0,0

"Characterization of the myotonic dystrophy region predicts multiple protein isoform-encoding mRNAs. The mutation underlying myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as an expansion of a polymorphic CTG-repeat in a gene encoding protein kinase activity .

"Haploinsufficiency of the transcription factors FOXC1 and FOXC2 results in aberrant ocular development. Anterior segment developmental disorders , including Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly ( ARA ) , variably associate with harmfully elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , which causes glaucoma . Clinically observed dysgenesis does not correlate with IOP , however , and the etiology of glaucoma development is not understood . The forkhead transcription factor genes Foxc1 ( formerly Mf1 ) and Foxc2 ( formerly Mfh1 ) are expressed in the mesenchyme from which the ocular drainage structures derive . Mutations in the human homolog of Foxc1 , FKHL7 , cause dominant anterior segment defects and glaucoma in various families . We show that Foxc1 ( + / - ) mice have anterior segment abnormalities similar to those reported in human patients . These abnormalities include small or absent Schlemms canal , aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork , iris hypoplasia , severely eccentric pupils and displaced Schwalbes line . The penetrance of clinically obvious abnormalities varies with genetic background . In some affected eyes , collagen bundles were half normal diameter , or collagen and elastic tissue were very sparse . Thus , abnormalities in extracellular matrix synthesis or organization may contribute to development of the ocular phenotypes . Despite the abnormalities in ocular drainage structures in Foxc1 ( + / - ) mice , IOP was normal in almost all mice analyzed , on all genetic backgrounds and at all ages . Similar abnormalities were found in Foxc2 ( + / - ) mice , but no disease-associated mutations were identified in the human homolog FKHL14 in 32 ARA patients . Foxc1 ( + / - ) and Foxc2 ( + / - ) mice are useful models for studying anterior segment development and its anomalies , and may allow identification of genes that interact with Foxc1 and Foxc2 ( or FKHL7 and FKHL14 ) to produce a phenotype with elevated IOP and glaucoma . .",0,0,1,0

"Effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in humans. BACKGROUND: In dogs, a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure. This study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 20 patients (14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain, we measured heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of saline (n=10, control subjects) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg/min (n=10). No variable changed with saline. With cocaine, the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0+/-0.4 (mean+/-SD) mg/L, similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intoxication. Cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume, but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV end-systolic volume, as well as a decrease in LV ejection fraction. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of LV systolic and diastolic performance.",1,0,0,0

He gave a five-year history of polyuria and polydipsia, during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucose. After recovery from hyperglycaemia, he remained polyuric despite normal blood glucose concentrations; water deprivation testing indicated nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, likely to be lithium-induced. We hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes, chronic polyuria due to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyperosmolar dehydration.",0,1,0,0
"An arylsulfatase A (ARSA) missense mutation (T274M) causing late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ; EC 3 . 1 1 . 6 6 . 8 ) . The 8 ARSA exons and adjacent intron boundaries from a patient with late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy were polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified in seven discrete reactions . Amplified ARSA exons were analysed for the presence of sequence alterations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis , followed by direct sequencing of PCR products . The patient was found to be homozygous for a C-- > T transition in exon IV that results in the substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue at amino acid 274 with a methionine ( T274M ) . Analysis of a further 29 MLD patients revealed the presence of five additional homozygotes for T274M . All 6 T274M homozygotes ( representing four families ) were of Lebanese descent , and all were known to be the result of consanguineous marriages . The altered amino acid is rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases from Escherichia coli to humans ; therefore , it is most likely that the resultant mutant protein will have little or no enzyme activity . This is consistent with the very low ARSA activity measured in these patients and their uniformly severe clinical presentation",0,0,1,0
"Effect of Hibiscus rosa sinensis on reserpine-induced neurobehavioral and biochemical alterations in rats. Effect of methanolic extract of Hibiscus rosa sinensis (100-300 mg/kg) was studied on reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and neurochemical alterations. The rats were treated with intraperitoneal reserpine (1 mg/kg, ip) for 3 days every other day. On day 5, vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions were counted for 5 min. Reserpine treated rats significantly developed vacuous chewing movements and tongue protrusions however, coadministration of Hibiscus rosa sinensis roots extract (100, 200 and 300 mg/kg, per orally) attenuated the effects. Biochemical analysis of brain revealed that the reserpine treatment significantly increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GSH), an index of oxidative stress process. Coadministration of extract significantly reduced the lipid peroxidation and reversed the decrease in brain SOD, CAT and GSH levels. The results of the present study suggested that Hibiscus rosa sinensis had a protective role against reserpine-induced orofacial dyskinesia and oxidative stress.",0,0,1,0
"Common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 do not contribute to early prostate cancer in Jewish men. BACKGROUND  Families with a high incidence of hereditary breast cancer , and subsequently shown to have terminating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 , appear to have a higher incidence of prostate cancer among male relatives . We aimed to determine whether the common germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed them to prostate cancer . METHODS  We examined genomic DNA from 83 ( for BRCA1 185delAG ) or 82 ( for BRCA2 6174delT ) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients , most of whom were treated at a relatively young age , for the most common germline mutation in each gene seen in the Ashkenazi population . RESULTS  Our study should have been able to detect a 4-5-fold increase in the risk of prostate cancer due to mutation of BRCA1 or BRCA2 . However , only one ( 1 . 15 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-3 . 6 % ) of the patients was heterozygous for the BRCA1 mutant allele , and only two were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation ( 2 . 4 % ; 95 % confidence interval , 0-6 . 2 % ) . CONCLUSIONS  The incidence of each of the germline mutations in these prostate cancer patients closely matched their incidence ( about 1 % ) in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population . This suggests that unlike cases of breast and ovarian cancers , mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 do not significantly predispose men to prostate cancer",0,0,0,1

"Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats. BACKGROUND: Fibrin sealants (FS) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neurosurgery. In order to increase clot stability, FS typically contain aprotinin, a natural fibrinolysis inhibitor. Recently, synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid (tAMCA) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin. However, tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures. We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS. METHOD: FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA (0.5-47.5 mg/ml) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats. The response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaesthesia. FINDINGS: FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours. The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA. Thus, FS containing 47.5 mg/ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats (n=6) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA (0.5 mg/ml) only evoked brief episodes of jerk-correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats. In contrast, FS containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activity. INTERPRETATION: Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS. Thus, use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient.",0,0,1,0
Pulmonary hypertension after ibuprofen prophylaxis in very preterm infants.

"Midazolam compared with thiopentone as an induction agent. In patients premedicated with scopolamine + morphine (+5 mg nitrazepam the evening before surgery), the sleep-inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg/kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thiopentone 4.67 mg/kg i.v. Somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group, but, although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted longer. On the whole, the differences between midazolam and thiopentone had no apparent clinical consequences. Midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia.",1,0,0,0

"Tightly linked flanking markers for the Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome, with application to carrier assessment. The Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome ( OCRL ) is characterized by congenital cataract , mental retardation , and defective renal tubular function . A map assignment of OCRL to Xq24-q26 has been made previously by linkage analysis with DXS42 at Xq24-q26 ( theta = 0 , z = 5 . 09 ) and with DXS10 at Xq26 ( theta = 0 , z = 6 . 45 ) . Two additional families were studied and three additional polymorphisms were identified at DXS42 by using a 35-kb sequence isolated with the probe detecting the original polymorphism at DXS42 . With additional OCRL families made informative for DXS42 , theta remained 0 with z = 6 . 63 ; and for DXS10 theta = 0 . 03 and z = 7 . 07 . Evidence for placing OCRL at Xq25 also comes from a female with Lowe syndrome and an X ; 3 translocation . We have used the Xq25 breakpoint in this patient to determine the position of OCRL relative to the two linked markers . Each derivative chromosome was isolated away from its normal counterpart in somatic cell hybrids . DXS42 was mapped to the derivative chromosome X containing Xpterq25 , and DXS10 was mapped to the derivative chromosome 3 containing Xq25-qter . The markers DXS10 and DXS42 therefore show tight linkage with OCRL in six families and flank the Xq25 breakpoint in a female patient with an X ; 3 translocation . Linkage analysis with flanking markers was used to assess OCRL carrier status in women at risk . Results , when compared with carrier determination by ophthalmologic examination , indicated that the slit-lamp exam can be a sensitive and specific method of carrier determination in many cases",0,1,1,0
"Genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers around the gene for familial adenomatous polyposis on chromosome 5. A genetic linkage map of six polymorphic DNA markers close to the gene ( APC ) for familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) on chromosome 5q is reported . One hundred fifty-five typed members of nine FAP kindred provided more than 90 meioses for linkage analysis . A number of crucial recombination events have been identified which are informative at three or more loci , allowing confident ordering of parts of the map . There was no evidence of genetic heterogeneity , with all families showing linkage of at least one chromosome 5 marker to the gene . Recombination data and two-point linkage analysis support a locus order of centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5 . 62-APC-EF5 62-APC-EF5 . 44-YN5 44-YN5 . 48-telomer e , although EF5 . 44 could lie in the interval L5 . 62-APC or ECB27-L5 . 62 .

"Carbamazepine-induced cardiac dysfunction. Characterization of two distinct clinical syndromes. A patient with sinus bradycardia and atrioventricular block, induced by carbamazepine, prompted an extensive literature review of all previously reported cases. From the analysis of these cases, two distinct forms of carbamazepine-associated cardiac dysfunction emerged. One patient group developed sinus tachycardias in the setting of a massive carbamazepine overdose. The second group consisted almost exclusively of elderly women who developed potentially life-threatening bradyarrhythmias or atrioventricular conduction delay, associated with either therapeutic or modestly elevated carbamazepine serum levels. Because carbamazepine is widely used in the treatment of many neurologic and psychiatric conditions, the recognition of the latter syndrome has important implications for the use of this drug in elderly patients.",1,0,1,0
"DSMM XI study: dose definition for intravenous cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib/dexamethasone for remission induction in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. A clinical trial was initiated to evaluate the recommended dose of cyclophosphamide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone as induction treatment before stem cell transplantation for younger patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Thirty patients were treated with three 21-day cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 plus dexamethasone 40 mg on the day of bortezomib injection and the day after plus cyclophosphamide at 900, 1,200, or 1,500 mg/m(2) on day 1. The maximum tolerated dose of cyclophosphamide was defined as 900 mg/m(2). At this dose level, 92% of patients achieved at least a partial response. The overall response rate [complete response (CR) plus partial response (PR)] across all dose levels was 77%, with a 10% CR rate. No patient experienced progressive disease. The most frequent adverse events were hematological and gastrointestinal toxicities as well as neuropathy. The results suggest that bortezomib in combination with cyclophosphamide at 900 mg/m(2) and dexamethasone is an effective induction treatment for patients with newly diagnosed MM that warrants further investigation.",0,0,1,0
"Deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with halothane, enflurane or isoflurane for middle-ear surgery. The feasibility of using labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, as a hypotensive agent in combination with inhalation anaesthetics (halothane, enflurane or isoflurane) was studied in 23 adult patients undergoing middle-ear surgery. The mean arterial pressure was decreased from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmHg to 52 +/- 1 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 98 +/- 10 min in the halothane (H) group, from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmHg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 129 +/- 11 min in the enflurane (E) group, and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmHg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 135 +/- 15 min in the isoflurane (I) group. The mean H concentration during hypotension in the inspiratory gas was 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, the mean E concentration 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and the mean I concentration 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%. In addition, the patients received fentanyl and d-tubocurarine. The initial dose of labetalol for lowering blood pressure was similar, 0.52-0.59 mg/kg, in all the groups. During hypotension, the heart rate was stable without tachy- or bradycardia. The operating conditions regarding bleeding were estimated in a double-blind manner, and did not differ significantly between the groups. During hypotension, the serum creatinine concentration rose significantly in all groups from the values before hypotension and returned postoperatively to the initial level in the other groups, except the isoflurane group. After hypotension there was no rebound phenomenon in either blood pressure or heart rate. These results indicate that labetalol induces easily adjustable hypotension without compensatory tachycardia and rebound hypertension.",1,1,0,0

"Neuroprotective effects of melatonin upon the offspring cerebellar cortex in the rat model of BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia. Cortical dysplasia is a malformation characterized by defects in proliferation, migration and maturation. This study was designed to evaluate the alterations in offspring rat cerebellum induced by maternal exposure to carmustine-[1,3-bis (2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosoure] (BCNU) and to investigate the effects of exogenous melatonin upon cerebellar BCNU-induced cortical dysplasia, using histological and biochemical analyses. Pregnant Wistar rats were assigned to five groups: intact-control, saline-control, melatonin-treated, BCNU-exposed and BCNU-exposed plus melatonin. Rats were exposed to BCNU on embryonic day 15 and melatonin was given until delivery. Immuno/histochemistry and electron microscopy were carried out on the offspring cerebellum, and levels of malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase were determined. Histopathologically, typical findings were observed in the cerebella from the control groups, but the findings consistent with early embryonic development were noted in BCNU-exposed cortical dysplasia group. There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU-exposed group, but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein, synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed, indicating a delayed maturation, and melatonin significantly reversed these changes. Malondialdehyde level in BCNU-exposed group was higher than those in control groups and melatonin decreased malondialdehyde levels in BCNU group (P<0.01), while there were no significant differences in the superoxide dismutase levels between these groups. These data suggest that exposure of animals to BCNU during pregnancy leads to delayed maturation of offspring cerebellum and melatonin protects the cerebellum against the effects of BCNU.",0,1,1,0

"Selegiline-induced postural hypotension in Parkinson's disease: a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdrawal. OBJECTIVES: The United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Research Group (UKPDRG) trial found an increased mortality in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) randomized to receive 10 mg selegiline per day and L-dopa compared with those taking L-dopa alone. Recently, we found that therapy with selegiline and L-dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline. This unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic failure. The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension. METHODS: The cardiovascular responses to standing and head-up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn. RESULTS: Head-up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline, one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures. A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing. Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug. Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action. CONCLUSION: This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L-dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension. The possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non-selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and metamphetamine are discussed.",1,0,1,0
"Transvenous right ventricular pacing during cardiopulmonary resuscitation of pediatric patients with acute cardiomyopathy. We describe the cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts on five patients who presented in acute circulatory failure from myocardial dysfunction. Three patients had acute viral myocarditis, one had a carbamazepine-induced acute eosinophilic myocarditis, and one had cardiac hemosiderosis resulting in acute cardiogenic shock. All patients were continuously monitored with central venous and arterial catheters in addition to routine noninvasive monitoring. An introducer sheath, a pacemaker, and sterile pacing wires were made readily available for the patients, should the need arise to terminate resistant cardiac dysrhythmias. All patients developed cardiocirculatory arrest associated with extreme hypotension and dysrhythmias within the first 48 hours of their admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Right ventricular pacemaker wires were inserted in all of them during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). In four patients, cardiac pacing was used, resulting in a temporary captured rhythm and restoration of their cardiac output. These patients had a second event of cardiac arrest, resulting in death, within 10 to 60 minutes. In one patient, cardiac pacing was not used, because he converted to normal sinus rhythm by electrical defibrillation within three minutes of initiating CPR. We conclude that cardiac pacing during resuscitative efforts in pediatric patients suffering from acute myocardial dysfunction may not have long-term value in and of itself; however, if temporary hemodynamic stability is achieved by this procedure, it may provide additional time needed to institute other therapeutic modalities.",1,0,0,0

Detailed analysis of genomic deletions in Norrie patients shows that they are heterogeneous , both in size and in position . By PCR analysis , we found that expression of the NDP gene was not confined to the eye or to the brain . An extensive DNA and protein sequence comparison between the human NDP gene and related genes from the database revealed homology with cysteine-rich protein-binding domains of immediate--early genes implicated in the regulation of cell proliferation .

"Metformin prevents experimental gentamicin-induced nephropathy by a mitochondria-dependent pathway. The antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patients. Here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxicity. Mitochondrial analysis, respiration intensity, levels of reactive oxygen species, permeability transition, and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administration. Metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin-mediated acute renal failure. This was accompanied by a lower activity of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant systems. Metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administration. These in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function. We found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components (cytochrome c, NADH), probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition pores. These injuries, partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain, were significantly decreased by metformin. Thus, our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can lessen gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis.",0,1,1,0
"A method for the measurement of tremor, and a comparison of the effects of tocolytic beta-mimetics. A method permitting measurement of finger tremor as a displacement-time curve is described, using a test system with simple amplitude calibration. The coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement-time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to punched tape. By means of a computer program, periods and amplitudes of tremor oscillations were calculated and classified. The event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determined. The actions of fenoterol-hydrobromide, ritodrin-HCl and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double-blind crossover study were tested by this method. At therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean tremor amplitude to about three times the control level. At the same time, the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10--20 ms, whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change significantly. After the end of fenoterol-hydrobromide infusion, tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following ritodrin-HCl infusion.",0,0,1,0

"Genetic mapping of the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome to a small interval on chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion of candidate genes EDH17B2 and RARA. A susceptibility gene for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer , BRCA1 , has been assigned by linkage analysis to chromosome 17q21 . Candidate genes in this region include EDH17B2 , which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II ( 17 beta-HSD II ) , and RARA , the gene for retinoic acid receptor alpha . We have typed 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families with eight polymorphisms from the chromosome 17q12-21 region , including two in the EDH17B2 gene . Genetic recombination with the breast cancer trait excludes RARA from further consideration as a candidate gene for BRCA1 . Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 map to a 6 cM interval ( between THRA1 and D17S579 ) and no recombination was observed between the two genes . However , direct sequencing of overlapping PCR products containing the entire EDH17B2 gene in four unrelated affected women did not uncover any sequence variation , other than previously described polymorphisms .

"The normal Huntington disease (HD) allele, or a closely linked gene, influences age at onset of HD. We evaluated the hypothesis that Huntington disease ( HD ) is influenced by the normal HD allele by comparing transmission patterns of genetically linked markers at the D4S10 locus in the normal parent against age at onset in the affected offspring . Analysis of information from 21 sibships in 14 kindreds showed a significant tendency for sibs who have similar onset ages to share the same D4S10 allele from the normal parent . Affected sibs who inherited different D4S10 alleles from the normal parent tended to have more variable ages at onset . These findings suggest that the expression of HD is modulated by the normal HD allele or by a closely linked locus . .",0,0,1,0
Seizure activity with imipenem therapy: incidence and risk factors. Two elderly patients with a history of either cerebral vascular accident (CVA) or head trauma and no evidence of renal disease developed seizures while receiving maximum doses of imipenem/cilastatin.

"Structure and genomic sequence of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM kinase ) gene. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has recently been identified as an unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat located in the 3 untranslated region of a gene encoding for a protein with putative serine-threonine protein kinase activity . In this report we present the genomic sequences of the human and murine DM kinase gene . A comparison of these sequences with each other and with known cDNA sequences from both species , led us to predict a translation initiation codon , as well as determine the organization of the DM kinase gene . Several polymorphisms within the human DM kinase gene have been identified , and PCR assays to detect two of these are described .

"Effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rats. AIM: Experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal DBS can control epileptic activity, but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defined. The aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin-induced epilepsy model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-five Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted DBS electrodes. In group-1 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was off and in the group-2 (n=10) hippocampal DBS was on (185 Hz, 0.5V, 1V, 2V, and 5V for 60 sec) following penicillin G injection intracortically. In the control group hippocampal DBS was on following 8  l saline injection intracortically. EEG recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin-G injection, and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency, amplitude, and power spectrum. RESULTS: High frequency hippocampal DBS suppressed the acute penicillin-induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus intensity. In the control group, hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5V stimulation. CONCLUSION: Our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic discharges. These results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal DBS in patients with epilepsy.",0,0,1,0

"Cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated hearts. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesia. SNP is authorized for clinical use in USA and UK, and ATP is clinically used in other countries such as Japan. We investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had devised. ATP (10 dogs) or SNP (10 dogs) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30% to 70% of control. Before, during and after induced hypotension, we measured major cardiovascular parameters. Hypotension induced by ATP was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.001), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.001), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), total body oxygen consumption (p less than 0.05), and heart rate (p less than 0.001); all these variables returned normal within 30 min after ATP was stopped. Cardiac output did not change. During hypotension produced by SNP similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure (p less than 0.01), central venous pressure (p less than 0.001), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (p less than 0.01), total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001), rate pressure product (p less than 0.001), and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood (p less than 0.05), while heart rate (p less than 0.001) and cardiac output (p less than 0.05) were increased. Recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after SNP had been stopped.

"Genetic basis and molecular mechanism for idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation causes more than 300 , 000 sudden deaths each year in the USA alone . In approximately 5-12 % of these cases , there are no demonstrable cardiac or non-cardiac causes to account for the episode , which is therefore classified as idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ) . A distinct group of IVF patients has been found to present with a characteristic electrocardiographic pattern . Because of the small size of most pedigrees and the high incidence of sudden death , however , molecular genetic studies of IVF have not yet been done . Because IVF causes cardiac rhythm disturbance , we investigated whether malfunction of ion channels could cause the disorder by studying mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene SCN5A . We have now identified a missense mutation , a splice-donor mutation , and a frameshift mutation in the coding region of SCN5A in three IVF families . We show that sodium channels with the missense mutation recover from inactivation more rapidly than normal and that the frameshift mutation causes the sodium channel to be non-functional . Our results indicate that mutations in cardiac ion-channel genes contribute to the risk of developing IVF . .",1,0,0,0
"Topotecan in combination with radiotherapy in unresectable glioblastoma: a phase 2 study. Improving glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment with radio-chemotherapy remains a challenge. Topotecan is an attractive option as it exhibits growth inhibition of human glioma as well as brain penetration. The present study assessed the combination of radiotherapy (60 Gy/30 fractions/40 days) and topotecan (0.9 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 on weeks 1, 3 and 5) in 50 adults with histologically proven and untreated GBM. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities was low and grade 3-4 hematological toxicities were reported in 20 patients (mainly lymphopenia and neutropenia). Partial response and stabilization rates were 2% and 32%, respectively, with an overall time to progression of 12 weeks. One-year overall survival (OS) rate was 42%, with a median OS of 40 weeks.

"Fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat. Dose-response relationships and effect of sex. Dose-response relationships, biochemical mechanisms, and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vitro. In the intact male and female rat, no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceride. With provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver, a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rats. Marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line (control) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceride. Accumulation of hepatic triglyceride, as a per cent of control values, in response to graded doses of tetracycline, did not differ significantly between male, female and pregnant rat livers. However, livers from female, and especially pregnant female rats, were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental conditions. These differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid. Depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50% of accumulated hepatic triglyceride, indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride-rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline.",0,1,1,0

"The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog: a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man. Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man, the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized. There is a need for a well-defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied. In four subacute toxicity studies, the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose-dependent incidence of anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia after 1-3 months of treatment. A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400-500 mg/kg cefonicid or 540-840 mg/kg cefazedone. All three cytopenias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment; the time required for recovery of the erythron (approximately 1 month) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets (hours to a few days). Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin, the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested; cefonicid (but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period (15 +/- 5 days) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug (61 +/- 24 days). This observation, along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs, suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia. We conclude that the administration of high doses of cefonicid or cefazedone to dogs can induce hematotoxicity similar to the cephalosporin-induced blood dyscrasias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders.",0,0,1,0

"Reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient: case report. Tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transplantation. However, adverse effects include cardiac toxicity. Herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transplantation. The hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardiography. Initially, allograft rejection was feared; however, myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detected. The blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time; thus, tacrolimus dosage was reduced. Myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur, as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biopsy. Thus, we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertrophy. In patients receiving tacrolimus therapy, blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement.",1,0,1,0

"A single origin of phenylketonuria in Yemenite Jews. Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is a metabolic disease caused by recessive mutations of the gene encoding the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) .

A limited number of point mutations account for most of the PKU cases in the European population . Here we report that a single molecular defect--a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene--is responsible for all the PKU cases among the Yemenite Jews . Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe that detects the carriers of this deletion indicated a high frequency of the defective gene in this community .

"Amiodarone and the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation and prior myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of amiodarone in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. BACKGROUND: Reports of severe bradyarrhythmia during amiodarone therapy are infrequent and limited to studies assessing the therapy's use in the management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias. METHODS: A study cohort of 8,770 patients age > or =65 years with a new diagnosis of AF was identified from a provincewide database of Quebec residents with a myocardial infarction (MI) between 1991 and 1999. Using a nested case-control design, 477 cases of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker were matched (1:4) to 1,908 controls. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) of pacemaker insertion associated with amiodarone use, controlling for baseline risk factors and exposure to sotalol, Class I antiarrhythmic agents, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin. RESULTS: amiodarone use was associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 2.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.30 to 3.54). This effect was modified by gender, with a greater risk in women versus men (OR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.70 to 8.75 vs. OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 0.80 to 2.89). Digoxin was the only other medication associated with an increased risk of pacemaker insertion (OR: 1.78, 95% CI: 1.37 to 2.31). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the use of amiodarone in elderly patients with AF and a previous MI increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring a permanent pacemaker. The finding of an augmented risk of pacemaker insertion in elderly women receiving amiodarone requires further investigation.",1,0,0,0

"Midline B3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyldopa. Previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyldopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord. The present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the B3 serotonin neurons in the medulla, coinciding with the raphe magnus. In spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats, microinjection of methyldopa into the area of the midline B3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30-40 mm Hg, which was maximal 2-3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT) injected intracerebroventricularly. However, intraspinal injection of 5,7-DHT to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypotension. Further, 5,7-DHT lesion of serotonin nerves travelling in the median forebrain bundle, one of the main ascending pathways from the B3 serotonin cells, did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline B3 serotonin methyldopa injection. It is concluded therefore that, unlike the ventrolateral B3 cells which mediate a methyldopa-induced hypotension via descending projections, the midline serotonin B3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyldopa, either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle, or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem.",1,0,1,0

Thus , potentiation of netrin activity by inhibitors may result from stabilization of DCC on the axons , and proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration by controlling the number of functional extracellular axon guidance receptors . .",0,0,0,1
"Nicotine potentiation of morphine-induced catalepsy in mice. In the present study, effects of nicotine on catalepsy induced by morphine in mice have been investigated. Morphine but not nicotine induced a dose-dependent catalepsy. The response of morphine was potentiated by nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, naloxone, mecamylamine, and hexamethonium to mice reduced catalepsy induced by a combination of morphine with nicotine. Intracerebroventricular injection of atropine, hexamethonium, and naloxone also decreased catalepsy induced by morphine plus nicotine. Intraperitoneal administration of atropine, but not intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection of hexamethonium, decreased the effect of a single dose of morphine. It was concluded that morphine catalepsy can be elicited by opioid and cholinergic receptors, and the potentiation of morphine induced by nicotine may also be mediated through cholinergic receptor mechanisms.",0,0,1,0

"Can lidocaine reduce succinylcholine induced postoperative myalgia?. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of lidocaine pretreatment on reduction of succinylcholine-induced myalgia in patients undergoing general anesthesia for gynecological surgery. One hundred and thirty-five patients were assigned to one of three groups in a prospective, double blind, randomized manner. Group PS, the control group, received normal saline and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group LS, lidocaine 1.5 mg x kg(-1) and succinylcholine 1.5 mg x kg(-1); Group PR, normal saline and rocuronium 0.6 mg x kg(-1). Morphine 0.1 mg x kg(-1) iv was given for premedication and all patients were monitored with a noninvasive blood pressure monitor, ECG and pulse oximetry. Anesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg(-1) thiopental iv. followed by succinylcholine (Group PS, LS) or rocuronium (Group PR) for tracheal intubation. Following administration of these agents, the presence, and degree of fasciculation were assessed visually on a four point scale by one investigator who was blinded to the drug administered. The blood pressure and heart rate of each patient were monitored on nine occasions. Twenty-four hours later, any myalgia experienced was assessed according to a structured questionaire and graded by a four point scale by one investigator blinded to the intraoperative management. The results indicate that muscle fasciculation was not found in Group PR while the patients in Group LS had a lower incidence of muscle fasciculation than those in Group PS (p < 0.001). At 24 h, the incidence of myalgia was higher in Group PS than in Group LS and PR (p < 0.05). A correlation was not found between the incidence of myalgia and the occurrence of muscle fasciculation. The changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were not significant among the three groups. In conclusion, where succinylcholine is used, lidocaine is proven to be the useful pretreatment agent for the reduction of postoperative myalgia.",1,0,0,0

"The attenuating effect of carteolol hydrochloride, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on neuroleptic-induced catalepsy in rats. It is known that beta-adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of akathisia, one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treatment. Neuroleptic-induced catalepsy, a model of neuroleptic-induced extrapyramidal side effects, was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic-induced akathisia in humans, although neuroleptic-induced catalepsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Therefore, the effects of carteolol, a beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, on haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and biperiden, a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Carteolol, as well as propranolol and biperiden, inhibited the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inhibitory effect of carteolol was almost comparable to that of propranolol, but was weaker than that of biperiden. Carteolol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as stereotypy and hyperlocomotion in rats. Carteolol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine-induced stereotypy and locomotor activity in rats. In addition, carteolol did not evoke 5-HT1A receptor-stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and forepaw treading and did not inhibit 5-hydroxytryptophan-induced head twitch in rats. Finally, carteolol did not inhibit physostigmine-induced lethality in rats. These results strongly suggest that carteolol improves haloperidol-induced catalepsy via its beta-adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of akathisia without attenuating neuroleptic-induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity.",0,0,1,0

"Glyburide-induced hepatitis. Drug-induced hepatotoxicity, although common, has been reported only infrequently with sulfonylureas. For glyburide, a second-generation sulfonylurea, only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist. Two patients with type II diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis-like syndrome soon after initiation of glyburide therapy. There was no serologic evidence of viral infection, and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. Both patients recovered quickly after stopping glyburide therapy and have remained well for a follow-up period of 1 year.

"Segregation distortion in myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disease which , in the typical pedigree , shows a three generation anticipation cascade . This results in infertility and congenital myotonic dystrophy ( CDM ) with the disappearance of DM in that pedigree . The concept of segregation distortion , where there is preferential transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus , has been put forward to explain partially the maintenance of DM in the population . In a survey of DM in Northern Ireland , 59 pedigrees were ascertained . Sibships where the status of all the members had been identified were examined to determine the transmission of the DM expansion from affected parents to their offspring . Where the transmitting parent was male , 58 . 3 % of the offspring were affected , and in the case of a female transmitting parent , 68 . 7 % were affected . Studies on meiotic drive in DM have shown increased transmission of the larger allele at the DM locus in non-DM heterozygotes for CTGn . This study provides further evidence that the DM expansion tends to be transmitted preferentially .",0,0,1,0

"Mice deficient in Six5 develop cataracts: implications for myotonic dystrophy. Expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 UTR of the gene DMPK at the DM1 locus on chromosome 19 causes myotonic dystrophy , a dominantly inherited disease characterized by skeletal muscle dystrophy and myotonia , cataracts and cardiac conduction defects . Targeted deletion of Dm15 , the mouse orthologue of human DMPK , produced mice with a mild myopathy and cardiac conduction abnormalities , but without other features of myotonic dystrophy , such as myotonia and cataracts . We , and others , have demonstrated that repeat expansion decreases expression of the adjacent gene SIX5 ( refs 7 , 8 ) , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor . To determine whether SIX5 deficiency contributes to the myotonic dystrophy phenotype , we disrupted mouse Six5 by replacing the first exon with a beta-galactosidase reporter . Six5-mutant mice showed reporter expression in multiple tissues , including the developing lens . Homozygous mutant mice had no apparent abnormalities of skeletal muscle function , but developed lenticular opacities at a higher rate than controls .

"Temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, modulates glomerular injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether chronic administration of temocapril, a long-acting non-SH group angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, reduced proteinuria, inhibited glomerular hypertrophy and prevented glomerulosclerosis in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) - induced nephrotic rats. Nephrosis was induced by injection of PAN (15mg/100g body weight) in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Four groups were used, i) the PAN group (14), ii) PAN/temocapril (13), iii) temocapril (14) and iv) untreated controls (15). Temocapril (8 mg/kg/day) was administered to the rats which were killed at weeks 4, 14 or 20. At each time point, systolic blood pressure (BP), urinary protein excretion and renal histopathological findings were evaluated, and morphometric image analysis was done. Systolic BP in the PAN group was significantly high at 4, 14 and 20 weeks, but was normal in the PAN/temocapril group. Urinary protein excretion in the PAN group increased significantly, peaking at 8 days, then decreased at 4 weeks, but rose again significantly at 14 and 20 weeks. Temocapril did not attenuate proteinuria at 8 days, but it did markedly lower it from weeks 4 to 20. The glomerulosclerosis index (GSI) was 6.21 % at 4 weeks and respectively 25.35 % and 30.49 % at 14 and 20 weeks in the PAN group. There was a significant correlation between urinary protein excretion and GSI (r = 0.808, p < 0.0001). The ratio of glomerular tuft area to the area of Bowman's capsules (GT/BC) in the PAN group was significantly increased, but it was significantly lower in the PAN/temocapril group. It appears that temocapril was effective in retarding renal progression and protected renal function in PAN neprotic rats.",1,1,0,0

"Norepinephrine signaling through beta-adrenergic receptors is critical for expression of cocaine-induced anxiety. BACKGROUND: Cocaine is a widely abused psychostimulant that has both rewarding and aversive properties. While the mechanisms underlying cocaine's rewarding effects have been studied extensively, less attention has been paid to the unpleasant behavioral states induced by cocaine, such as anxiety. METHODS: In this study, we evaluated the performance of dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), in the elevated plus maze (EPM) to examine the contribution of noradrenergic signaling to cocaine-induced anxiety. RESULTS: We found that cocaine dose-dependently increased anxiety-like behavior in control (Dbh +/-) mice, as measured by a decrease in open arm exploration. The Dbh -/- mice had normal baseline performance in the EPM but were completely resistant to the anxiogenic effects of cocaine. Cocaine-induced anxiety was also attenuated in Dbh +/- mice following administration of disulfiram, a dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. In experiments using specific adrenergic antagonists, we found that pretreatment with the beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist propranolol blocked cocaine-induced anxiety-like behavior in Dbh +/- and wild-type C57BL6/J mice, while the alpha(1) antagonist prazosin and the alpha(2) antagonist yohimbine had no effect. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that noradrenergic signaling via beta-adrenergic receptors is required for cocaine-induced anxiety in mice.",0,0,1,0

"Chronic lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of chronic selective neuronal lesion of rostral ventrolateral medulla on mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and neurogenic tone in conscious, unrestrained spontaneously hypertensive rats. The lesions were placed via bilateral microinjections of 30 nmol/200 nl N-methyl-D-aspartic acid. The restimulation of this area with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid 15 days postlesion failed to produce a pressor response. One day postlesion, the resting mean arterial pressure was significantly decreased in lesioned rats when compared with sham rats (100 +/- 7 versus 173 +/- 4 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Fifteen days later, the lesioned group still showed values significantly lower than the sham group (150 +/- 6 versus 167 +/- 5 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). No significant heart rate differences were observed between the sham and lesioned groups. The ganglionic blocker trimethaphan (5 mg/kg i.v.) caused similar reductions in mean arterial pressure in both lesioned and sham groups. The trimethaphan-induced hypotension was accompanied by a significant bradycardia in lesioned rats (-32 +/- 13 beats per minute) but a tachycardia in sham rats (+33 +/- 12 beats per minute) 1 day postlesion. Therefore, rostral ventrolateral medulla neurons appear to play a significant role in maintaining hypertension in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats. Spinal or suprabulbar structures could be responsible for the gradual recovery of the hypertension in the lesioned rats.",1,0,1,0

"Centrosome amplification and a defective G2-M cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability in BRCA1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells. Germline mutations of the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women to breast and ovarian cancers . To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1-related tumorigenesis , we derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying a targeted deletion of exon 11 of the Brca1 gene . We show that the mutant cells maintain an intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint and proliferate poorly . However , a defective G2-M checkpoint in these cells is accompanied by extensive chromosomal abnormalities . Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple , functional centrosomes , which lead to unequal chromosome segregation , abnormal nuclear division , and aneuploidy . These data uncover an essential role of BRCA1 in maintaining genetic stability through the regulation of centrosome duplication and the G2-M checkpoint and provide a molecular basis for the role of BRCA1 in tumorigenesis . .",0,0,1,1
"Effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the sphincter of Oddi spasm evoked by prostigmine-morphine administration. OBJECTIVE: In this study the effect of glyceryl trinitrate on the prostigmine-morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm was evaluated in nine female patients with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. METHOD: Sphincter of Oddi spasm was induced by prostigmine-morphine administration (0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously) and visualized by quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire procedure was repeated during glyceryl trinitrate infusion (Nitrolingual 1 microg/kg/min for 120 min). RESULTS: Prostigmine-morphine provocation caused significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 +/- 5.05 vs. 22.77 +/- 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 +/- 5.99 vs. 40.0 +/- 2.88) and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 +/- 16.01 vs. 27.37 +/- 2.19), HH (117.61 +/- 14.71 vs. 31.85 +/- 3.99) and CBD (158.11 +/- 9.18 vs. 40.1 +/- 6.24), indicating a complete spasm at the level of the sphincter of Oddi. Glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely normalized the prostigmine-morphine-induced alterations in these quantitative parameters (TmaX over the LP: 11.33 +/- 1.13; over the HH: 18.88 +/- 1.48; and over the CBD: 36.22 +/- 1.92; and T1/2 over the LP: 28.21 +/- 1.83; over the HH: 33.42 +/- 3.10; and over the CBD: 41.66 +/- 6.33), suggesting an effective sphincter-relaxing effect of glyceryl trinitrate. CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence of the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate on the morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in humans. Since glyceryl trinitrate is able to overcome even the drastic effect of morphine, it might be of relevance in the treatment of sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia.",0,1,0,0

"Repeated trimipramine induces dopamine D2/D3 and alpha1-adrenergic up-regulation. Trimipramine (TRI), which shows a clinical antidepressant activity, is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5-hydroxytryptamine, nor does it induce beta-adrenergic down-regulation. The mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to find out whether TRI given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1-adrenergic systems, demonstrated by us previously for various antidepressants. TRI was given to male Wistar rats and male Albino Swiss mice perorally twice daily for 14 days. In the acute experiment TRI (given i.p.) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5-hydroxytryptophan head twitches in rats. TRI given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d-amphetamine, quinpirole and (+)-7-hydroxy-dipropyloaminotetralin (dopamine D2 and D3 effects). The stereotypies induced by d-amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by TRI. It increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine (given intraventricularly) in rats, evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice, both these effects being mediated by an alpha1-adrenergic receptor. It may be concluded that, like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously, TRI given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine D2 and D3 (locomotor activity but not stereotypy) as well as alpha1-adrenergic receptors to their agonists. A question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants, suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity.",0,1,1,0
"Novel mutations of the ATP7B gene in Japanese patients with Wilson disease. Wilson disease ( WD ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by copper accumulation in the liver , brain , kidneys , and corneas , and culminating in copper toxication in these organs . In this study , we analyzed mutations of the responsible gene , ATP7B , in four Japanese patients with WD . By direct sequencing , we identified five mutations , of which two were novel , and 16 polymorphisms , of which 6 were novel . The mutations 2871delC and 2513delA shift the reading frame so that truncated abnormal protein is expected . In contrast to these mutations found in patients with hepatic-type of early onset , the mutations A874V , R778L , and 3892delGTC were either missense mutations or in frame 1-amino acid deletion , and occurred in the patients with hepato-neurologic type of late onset .

In particular , R778L is known to be more prevalent in Asian countries than in other countries of the world . Our data are compatible with the hypothesis that the mutations tend to occur in a population-specific manner . Therefore , the accumulation of the types of mutations in Japanese patients with WD will facilitate the fast and effective genetic diagnosis of WD in Japanese patients . .",0,1,1,0

"Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users. RATIONALE: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. OBJECTIVES: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. METHOD: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. RESULTS: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. CONCLUSIONS: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy.",0,1,1,0
"Regional mapping of the phenylalanine hydroxylase gene and the phenylketonuria locus in the human genome. Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disorder of amino acid metabolism caused by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ; phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase , EC 1 . 14 . 16 . 1 ) . A cDNA clone for human PAH has previously been used to assign the corresponding gene to human chromosome 12 . To define the regional map position of the disease locus and the PAH gene on human chromosome 12 , DNA was isolated from human-hamster somatic cell hybrids with various deletions of human chromosome 12 and was analyzed by Southern blot analysis using the human cDNA PAH clone as a hybridization probe . From these results , together with detailed biochemical and cytogenetic characterization of the hybrid cells , the region on chromosome 12 containing the human PAH gene has been defined as 12q14 . 3----qter 3----qter . The PAH map position on chromosome 12 was further localized by in situ hybridization of 125I-labeled human PAH cDNA to chromosomes prepared from a human lymphoblastoid cell line . Results of these experiments demonstrated that the region on chromosome 12 containing the PAH gene and the PKU locus in man is 12q22----12q24 . 1 . These results not only provide a regionalized map position for a major human disease locus but also can serve as a reference point for linkage analysis with other DNA markers on human chromosome 12",0,1,1,0

"Fusion genes resulting from alternative chromosomal translocations are overexpressed by gene-specific mechanisms in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Chromosomal translocations identified in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in deregulated expression of protooncogenes or creation of chimeric proteins with tumorigenic potential . In the pediatric solid tumor alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , a consistent t ( 2 ; 13 ) ( q35 ; q14 ) or variant t ( 1 ; 13 ) ( p36 ; q14 ) translocation generates PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins , respectively . In this report , we demonstrate that in addition to functional alterations these translocations are associated with fusion product overexpression . Furthermore , PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression occurs by distinct mechanisms . Transcription of PAX3-FKHR is increased relative to wild-type PAX3 by a copy number-independent process . In contrast , PAX7-FKHR overexpression results from fusion gene amplification . Thus , gene-specific mechanisms were selected to overexpress PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , presumably due to differences in regulation between the wild-type loci . We postulate that these overexpression mechanisms ensure a critical level of gene product for the oncogenic effects of these fusions . .",0,0,1,1

"Erythropoietin restores the anemia-induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumors. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumors. Anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg i.v.) resulting in a long-lasting reduction (30%) of the hemoglobin concentration. In a second group, the development of anemia was prevented by rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered s.c. three times/week starting 7 days before carboplatin application. Four days after carboplatin treatment, tumors (DS-sarcoma of the rat) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se. When tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg i.p.) 5 days after implantation, a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was observed. In the anemia group, the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with nonanemic controls (13.3 days versus 8.6 days). In the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO treatment, growth delay was comparable with that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that chemotherapy-induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas correction of anemia by rHuEPO treatment (epoetin alpha) increases the sensitivity, probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue.",0,0,0,1

A report from the Children's Oncology Group. Concerns about long-term methotrexate (MTX) neurotoxicity in the 1990s led to modifications in intrathecal (IT) therapy, leucovorin rescue, and frequency of systemic MTX administration in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In this study, neurocognitive outcomes and neuroradiologic evidence of leukoencephalopathy were compared in children treated with intense central nervous system (CNS)-directed therapy (P9605) versus those receiving fewer CNS-directed treatment days during intensive consolidation (P9201). A total of 66 children from 16 Pediatric Oncology Group institutions with ""standard-risk"" acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 1.00 to 9.99 years at diagnosis, without evidence of CNS leukemia at diagnosis were enrolled on ACCL0131: 28 from P9201 and 38 from P9605. Magnetic resonance imaging scans and standard neuropsychological tests were performed >2.6 years after the end of treatment. Significantly more P9605 patients developed leukoencephalopathy compared with P9201 patients (68%, 95% confidence interval 49%-83% vs. 22%, 95% confidence interval 5%-44%; P=0.001) identified as late as 7.7 years after the end of treatment. Overall, 40% of patients scored <85 on either Verbal or Performance IQ. Children on both studies had significant attention problems, but P9605 children scored below average on more neurocognitive measures than those treated on P9201 (82%, 14/17 measures vs. 24%, 4/17 measures). This supports ongoing concerns about intensive MTX exposure as a major contributor to CNS late effects.",0,0,1,1

"Phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia-induced hypotension. BACKGROUND: Vasopressor agents are used to correct anesthesia-induced hypotension. We describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) following anesthesia-induced hypotension. METHODS: Following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl (0.15 mg kg(-1)) and propofol (2.0 mg kg(-1)), 13 patients received phenylephrine (0.1 mg iv) and 12 patients received ephedrine (10 mg iv) to restore mean arterial pressure (MAP). Heart rate (HR), MAP, stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO), and frontal lobe oxygenation (S(c)O(2)) were registered. RESULTS: Induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in MAP, HR, SV, and CO concomitant with an elevation in S(c)O(2). After administration of phenylephrine, MAP increased (51 +/- 12 to 81 +/- 13 mmHg; P < 0.001; mean +/- SD). However, a 14% (from 70 +/- 8% to 60 +/- 7%) reduction in S(c)O(2) (P < 0.05) followed with no change in CO (3.7 +/- 1.1 to 3.4 +/- 0.9 l min(-1)). The administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in MAP (53 +/- 9 to 79 +/- 8 mmHg; P < 0.001), restored CO (3.2 +/- 1.2 to 5.0 +/- 1.3 l min(-1)), and preserved S(c)O(2). CONCLUSIONS: The utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on S(c)O(2) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in CO.",1,0,0,0

"Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine (10-40 mg/kg BW/3 times weekly) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity. 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity. Moreover, detailed ophthalmologic and audiologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patients. Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan-type dyschromatopsy, sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits. Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high-frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type. Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3, and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels. The data indicate that audiovisual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine. Periodical audiovisual monitoring should be performed on hemodialyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible.",0,0,1,0

"Medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure: a case-control study. BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure (ALF) in the UK. Patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance dependence. AIMS AND METHODS: We compared the severity of pretransplant illness, psychiatric co-morbidity, medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation (LT) emergently between 1999-2004 for acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=36) with age- and sex-matched patients undergoing emergent LT for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF (n=35) and elective LT for chronic liver disease (CLD, n=34). RESULTS: Acetaminophen-induced ALF patients undergoing LT had a greater severity of pre-LT illness reflected by higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two groups. Twenty (56%) acetaminophen-induced ALF patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before LT (non-acetaminophen-induced ALF=0/35, CLD=2/34; P<0.01 for all) and nine (25%) had a previous suicide attempt. During follow-up (median 5 years), there were no significant differences in rejection (acute and chronic), graft failure or survival between the groups (acetaminophen-induced ALF 1 year 87%, 5 years 75%; non-acetaminophen-induced ALF 88%, 78%; CLD 93%, 82%: P>0.6 log rank). Two acetaminophen-induced ALF patients reattempted suicide post-LT (one died 8 years post-LT). CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance, outcomes for patients transplanted emergently for acetaminophen-induced ALF were comparable to those transplanted for non-acetaminophen-induced ALF and electively for CLD. Multidisciplinary approaches with long-term psychiatric follow-up may contribute to low post-transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non-compliance.",0,1,1,0

"The safety and efficacy of combination N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) and zidovudine in patients with HIV-1 infection and 200-500 CD4 cells/mm3. We conducted a double-blind, randomized phase II study to evaluate the safety and activity of combination therapy with N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (SC-48334) (an alpha-glucosidase I inhibitor) and zidovudine versus zidovudine alone. Patients with 200 to 500 CD4 cells/mm3 who tolerated < or = 12 weeks of prior zidovudine therapy received SC-48334 (1000 mg every 8 h) and zidovudine (100 mg every 8 h) or zidovudine and placebo. Sixty patients received combination therapy and 58, zidovudine and placebo. Twenty-three patients (38%) and 15 (26%), in the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively, discontinued therapy (p = 0.15). The mean SC-48334 steady-state trough level (4.04 +/- 0.99 micrograms/ml) was below the in vitro inhibitory concentration for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The mean increase in CD4 cells at week 4 was 73.8 cells/mm3 and 52.4 cells/mm3 for the combination and zidovudine groups, respectively (p > 0.36).

"Paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination chemotherapy within a multidisciplinary therapeutic approach in metastatic nonsmall cell lung carcinoma. BACKGROUND: Cisplatin-based chemotherapy combinations improve quality of life and survival in advanced nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The emergence of new active drugs might translate into more effective regimens for the treatment of this disease. METHODS: The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility, response rate, and toxicity of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination to treat metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were treated with a combination of paclitaxel (135 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m(2) given intravenously in 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. Although responding patients were scheduled to receive consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received preplanned second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the response and toxicity rates reported refer only to the chemotherapy regimen given. RESULTS: All the patients were examined for toxicity; 34 were examinable for response. An objective response was observed in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53. 7-85.4%). After 154 courses of therapy, the median dose intensity was 131 mg/m(2) for paclitaxel (97.3%), 117 mg/m(2) for cisplatin (97.3%), and 1378 mg/m(2) for gemcitabine (86.2%). World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. Nonhematologic toxicities were mild. After a median follow-up of 22 months, the median progression free survival rate was 7 months, and the median survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine is well tolerated and shows high activity in metastatic NSCLC.

"The risks of aprotinin and tranexamic acid in cardiac surgery: a one-year follow-up of 1188 consecutive patients. BACKGROUND: Our aim was to investigate postoperative complications and mortality after administration of aprotinin compared to tranexamic acid in an unselected, consecutive cohort. METHODS: Perioperative data from consecutive cardiac surgery patients were prospectively collected between September 2005 and June 2006 in a university-affiliated clinic (n = 1188). During the first 5 mo, 596 patients received aprotinin (Group A); in the next 5 mo, 592 patients were treated with tranexamic acid (Group T). Except for antifibrinolytic therapy, the anesthetic and surgical protocols remained unchanged. RESULTS: The pre- and intraoperative variables were comparable between the treatment groups. Postoperatively, a significantly higher incidence of seizures was found in Group T (4.6% vs 1.2%, P < 0.001). This difference was also significant in the primary valve surgery and the high risk surgery subgroups (7.9% vs 1.2%, P = 0.003; 7.3% vs 2.4%, P = 0.035, respectively). Persistent atrial fibrillation (7.9% vs 2.3%, P = 0.020) and renal failure (9.7% vs 1.7%, P = 0.002) were also more common in Group T, in the primary valve surgery subgroup. On the contrary, among primary coronary artery bypass surgery patients, there were more acute myocardial infarctions and renal dysfunction in Group A (5.8% vs 2.0%, P = 0.027; 22.5% vs 15.2%, P = 0.036, respectively). The 1-yr mortality was significantly higher after aprotinin treatment in the high risk surgery group (17.7% vs 9.8%, P = 0.034). CONCLUSION: Both antifibrinolytic drugs bear the risk of adverse outcome depending on the type of cardiac surgery. Administration of aprotinin should be avoided in coronary artery bypass graft and high risk patients, whereas administration of tranexamic acid is not recommended in valve surgery.",1,1,1,0

"Identification and localization of huntingtin in brain and human lymphoblastoid cell lines with anti-fusion protein antibodies. The Huntington disease ( HD ) phenotype is associated with expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the IT15 gene , which is predicted to encode a 348-kDa protein named huntington . We used polyclonal and monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies to identify native huntingtin in rat , monkey , and human . Western blots revealed a protein with the expected molecular weight which is present in the soluble fraction of rat and monkey brain tissues and lymphoblastoid cells from control cases . In lymphoblastoid cell lines from juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases , both normal and mutant huntingtin are expressed , and increasing repeat expansion leads to lower levels of the mutant protein . Immunocytochemistry indicates that huntingtin is located in neurons throughout the brain , with the highest levels evident in larger neurons . In the human striatum , huntingtin is enriched in a patch-like distribution , potentially corresponding to the first areas affected in HD . Subcellular localization of huntingtin is consistent with a cytosolic protein primarily found in somatodendritic regions . Huntingtin appears to particularly associate with microtubules , although some is also associated with synaptic vesicles . On the basis of the localization of huntingtin in association with microtubules , we speculate that the mutation impairs the cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria , vesicles , or other organelles or molecules . .",0,0,1,0
"Neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in patients with acute liver failure. Defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure (ALF). In the present study, oxygen radical production in patients with ALF due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunteers. Neutrophils from 14 ALF patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with ALF or control serum. Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by ALF neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with ALF serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects (P < 0.01). This defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used (P < 0.05). Superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) from a further 18 ALF patients was unaffected compared with control neutrophils. Serum C3 complement levels were significantly reduced in ALF patients compared with control subjects (P < 0.0005). These results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in ALF due to paracetamol overdose, that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement, possibly connected to the complement receptor.",0,1,0,0

"Continuous infusion tobramycin combined with carbenicillin for infections in cancer patients. The cure rate of infections in cancer patients is adversely affected by neutropenia (less than 1,000/mm3). In particular, patients with severe neutropenia (less than 100/mm3) have shown a poor response to antibiotics. To overcome the adverse effects of neutropenia, tobramycin was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent carbenicillin. Tobramycin was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg/m2 and carbenicillin was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hours. There were 125 infectious episodes in 116 cancer patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. The overall cure rate was 70%. Pneumonia was the most common infection and 61% of 59 episodes were cured. Gram-negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69% of these infections were cured. The most common pathogen was Klebsiella pneumoniae and this, together with Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, accounted for 74% of all gram-negative bacillary infections. Response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count, with a 62% cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe neutropenia. However, failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected response. Azotemia was the major side effect recognized, and it occurred in 11% of episodes. Major azotemia (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg/dl or BUN greater than 50 mg/dl) occurred in only 2%. Azotemia was not related to duration of therapy or serum tobramycin concentration.

"Serotonergic drugs, benzodiazepines and baclofen block muscimol-induced myoclonic jerks in a strain of mice. In male Swiss mice, muscimol produced myoclonic jerks. A 3 mg/kg (i.p.) dose induced this response in all of the mice tested and the peak response of 73 jerks per min was observed between 27 and 45 min. Increasing the brain serotonin levels by the administration of 5-hydroxytryptophan (80-160 mg/kg) in combination with a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor resulted in an inhibition of the muscimol effect. However, in a similar experiment l-dopa (80-160 mg/kg) was without effect. In doses of 3-10 mg/kg, the serotonin receptor agonist MK-212 caused a dose-dependent blockade of the response of muscimol. Of the benzodiazepines, clonazepam (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) was found to be several fold more potent than diazepam (0.3-3 mg/kg) in blocking the myoclonic jerks. While (-)-baclofen (1-3 mg/kg) proved to be an effective antagonist of muscimol, its (+)-isomer (5-20 mg/kg) lacked this property. Considering the fact that 5-HTP and the benzodiazepines have been found to be beneficial in the management of clinical myoclonus, the muscimol-induced myoclonus seems to be a satisfactory animal model that may prove useful for the development of new drug treatments for this condition. Our present study indicated the possible value of MK-212 and (-)-baclofen in the management of clinical myoclonus.",0,0,1,0
"Cancer incidence and metolachlor use in the Agricultural Health Study: An update. UNASSIGNED: Metolachlor, a widely used herbicide, is classified as a Group C carcinogen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency based on increased liver neoplasms in female rats. Epidemiologic studies of the health effects of metolachlor have been limited. The Agricultural Health Study (AHS) is a prospective cohort study including licensed private and commercial pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina enrolled 1993-1997. We evaluated cancer incidence through 2010/2011 (NC/IA) for 49,616 applicators, 53% of whom reported ever using metolachlor. We used Poisson regression to evaluate relations between two metrics of metolachlor use (lifetime days, intensity-weighted lifetime days) and cancer incidence. We saw no association between metolachlor use and incidence of all cancers combined (n = 5,701 with a 5-year lag) or most site-specific cancers. For liver cancer, in analyses restricted to exposed workers, elevations observed at higher categories of use were not statistically significant. However, trends for both lifetime and intensity-weighted lifetime days of metolachor use were positive and statistically significant with an unexposed reference group. A similar pattern was observed for follicular cell lymphoma, but no other lymphoma subtypes. An earlier suggestion of increased lung cancer risk at high levels of metolachlor use in this cohort was not confirmed in this update. This suggestion of an association between metolachlor and liver cancer among pesticide applicators is a novel finding and echoes observation of increased liver neoplasms in some animal studies. However, our findings for both liver cancer and follicular cell lymphoma warrant follow-up to better differentiate effects of metolachlor use from other factors.",0,1,1,1
"Changes of sodium and ATP affinities of the cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase during and after nitric oxide deficient hypertension. In the cardiovascular system, NO is involved in the regulation of a variety of functions. Inhibition of NO synthesis induces sustained hypertension. In several models of hypertension, elevation of intracellular sodium level was documented in cardiac tissue. To assess the molecular basis of disturbances in transmembraneous transport of Na+, we studied the response of cardiac (Na,K)-ATPase to NO-deficient hypertension induced in rats by NO-synthase inhibition with 40 mg/kg/day N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) for 4 four weeks. After 4-week administration of L-NAME, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) increased by 36%. Two weeks after terminating the treatment, the SBP recovered to control value. When activating the (Na,K)-ATPase with its substrate ATP, no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO-deficient rats. During activation with Na+, the Vmax remained unchanged, however the K(Na) increased by 50%, indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na+-binding site in NO-deficient rats. After recovery from hypertension, the activity of (Na,K)-ATPase increased, due to higher affinity of the ATP-binding site, as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP. The K(Na) value for Na+ returned to control value. Inhibition of NO-synthase induced a reversible hypertension accompanied by depressed Na+-extrusion from cardiac cells as a consequence of deteriorated Na+-binding properties of the (Na,K)-ATPase. After recovery of blood pressure to control values, the extrusion of Na+ from cardiac cells was normalized, as revealed by restoration of the (Na,K)-ATPase activity.",1,0,0,0

Thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin, ISO was given subcutaneously and when ISO induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morphometrically analyzed 7 days later, a highly significant correlation (r = 0.83, 2 p = 0.006) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appeared. The myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rats. The norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained unchanged. An enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta-adrenergic receptors could, therefore, explain this catecholamine resistance. The rapid reversion after insulin treatment excludes the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the ISO resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rats. The phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.",1,0,1,0

"Potential deleterious effect of furosemide in radiocontrast nephropathy. The purpose of the study was to determine the efficacy of furosemide in addition to intravenous fluids in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy. 18 patients, referred to a radiocontrast study, considered at risk because of preexisting renal insufficiency, were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial, performed at the secondary care center of a 1,100-bed private university hospital. In addition to fluids, the treatment group received furosemide (mean dose 110 mg) intravenously 30 min prior to the injection of contrast material. The control group received fluids (mean 3 liters). Radiological studies were mostly angiographies performed with both ionic and non-ionic contrast material, at an average dose of 245 ml. Renal function significantly deteriorated in the group pretreated with furosemide (p < 0.005 by ANOVA), with a rise in serum creatinine from 145 +/- 13 to 182 +/- 16 mumol/l at 24 h, while no change occurred in the control group (from 141 +/- 6 to 142 +/- 7 mumol/l). Renal failure was associated with weight loss in the furosemide-treated group. Furosemide may be deleterious in the prevention of radiocontrast nephropathy.",0,1,0,0
"Effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery disease. A hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic study in patients without heart failure. The effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease, but have not been measured previously in man. We assessed the effects of ouabain (0.015 mg/kg body weight) on hemodynamic, volumetric, and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart failure. Because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations, we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was omitted. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain, even though they were initially elevated in only two patients. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure fell from 11.5+/-1.4 (mean+/-SE) to 5.6+/-0.9 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell from 100+/-17 to 82+/-12 ml/m2 (P less than 0.01) 1 h after ouabain infusion was completed. The maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68+/-0.11 ml/s to 2.18+/-0.21 muscle-lengths/s (P less than 0.05) and is consistent with an increase in contractility. No significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patients. No significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patients. We conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end-diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal. Though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension, and, therefore, of myocardial oxygen consumption, it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen consumption. Nevertheless, compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism.",1,0,1,0
"A common molecular basis for rearrangement disorders on chromosome 22q11. The chromosome 22q11 region is susceptible to rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors . Three congenital anomaly disorders , cat-eye syndrome , der ( ) syndrome and velo-cardio-facial syndrome / DiGeorge syndrome ( VCFS / DGS ) are associated with tetrasomy , trisomy or monosomy , respectively , for part of chromosome 22q11 . VCFS / DGS is the most common syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements . In order to determine whether there are particular regions on 22q11 that are prone to rearrangements , the deletion end-points in a large number of VCFS / DGS patients were defined by haplotype analysis . Most VCFS / DGS patients have a similar 3 Mb deletion , some have a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1 . 5 Mb deletion and a few rare patients have unique deletions or translocations . The high prevalence of the disorder in the population and the fact that most cases occur sporadically suggest that sequences at or near the breakpoints confer susceptibility to chromosome rearrangements . To investigate this hypothesis , we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS / DGS patients with all three classes of deletions and we now show that the breakpoints occur within similar low copy repeats , termed LCR22s . To support this idea further , we identified a family that carries an interstitial duplication of the same 3 Mb region that is deleted in VCFS / DGS patients . We present models to explain how the LCR22s can mediate different homologous recombination events , thereby generating a number of rearrangements that are associated with congenital anomaly disorders . We identified five additional copies of the LCR22 on 22q11 that may mediate other rearrangements leading to disease .",1,0,1,1

"Enhanced bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoniazid. High doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia, an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the present study, the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthetised with chloralose-urethane. Isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol, pindolol, labetalol and atenolol, as well as after clonidine, but not after hexamethonium or carbachol. Enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methylatropine or previously vagotomised. These results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with GABAergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic tone. Such interference could be exerted centrally, possibly at the nucleus ambiguus, or peripherally at the sinus node.",0,0,1,0
"Genomic rearrangements of the APC tumor-suppressor gene in familial adenomatous polyposis. Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor-suppressor gene result in the hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . Almost all APC mutations that have been identified are single-nucleotide alterations , small insertions , or small deletions that would truncate the protein product of the gene . No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement of APC has been described , and the prevalence of this type of mutation in FAP patients is not clear . We screened 49 potential FAP families and identified 26 different germline APC mutations in 30 families . Four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements . Two of these four rearrangements were complex , involving deletion and insertion of nucleotides . Of these four rearrangements , one resulted in the deletion of exons 11 and 12 and two others resulted in either complete or partial deletion of exon 14 . The fourth rearrangement grossly altered the sequence within intron 14 . Although this rearrangement did not affect any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level , it caused inappropriate splicing of exon 14 . These rearrangements were initially revealed by analyzing cDNAs and could not have been identified by using mutation detection methods that screened each exon individually . The identification of a rearrangement that did not alter any coding exons yet affected the splicing further underscores the importance of using cDNA for mutation analysis . The identification of four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests that genomic rearrangements are frequent germline APC mutations . .",0,0,0,1
"Tumor suppression and apoptosis of human prostate carcinoma mediated by a genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of male cancer deaths in the United States . Yet , despite a large international effort , little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie this devastating disease . Prostate secretory epithelial cells and androgen-dependent prostate carcinomas undergo apoptosis in response to androgen deprivation and , furthermore , most prostate carcinomas become androgen independent and refractory to further therapeutic manipulations during disease progression . Definition of the genetic events that trigger apoptosis in the prostate could provide important insights into critical pathways in normal development as well as elucidate the perturbations of those key pathways in neoplastic transformation . We report the functional definition of a novel genetic locus within human chromosome 10pter-q11 that mediates both in vivo tumor suppression and in vitro apoptosis of prostatic adenocarcinoma cells . A defined fragment of human chromosome 10 was transferred via microcell fusion into a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line . Microcell hybrids containing only the region 10pter-q11 were suppressed for tumorigenicity following injection of microcell hybrids into nude mice . Furthermore , the complemented hybrids undergo programmed cell death in vitro via a mechanism that does not require nuclear localization of p53 . These data functionally define a novel genetic locus , designated PAC1 , for prostate adenocarcinoma 1 , involved in tumor suppression of human prostate carcinoma and furthermore strongly suggest that the cell death pathway can be functionally restored in prostatic adenocarcinoma . .",0,0,1,1
"Serotonin reuptake inhibitors, paranoia, and the ventral basal ganglia. Antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patients. Five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here. Elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptoms. Complicated depressive disorders (including atypicality of course and symptomatology, chronicity, psychosis, bipolarity, and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although the pharmacology and neurobiology of paranoia remain cryptic, several mechanisms, including 5HT3 receptor-mediated dopamine release, beta-noradrenergic receptor downregulation, or GABAB receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia (possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits), might apply to this phenomenon. These cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding paranoia.",0,0,1,0

"Serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine-induced psychosis in a Japanese population. BACKGROUND: Altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. The serotonin 6 (5-HT6) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, and d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. In addition, the disrupted prepulse inhibition induced by d-amphetamine or phencyclidine was restored by 5-HT6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rats. These animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and the above evidence suggests that altered 5-HT6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders. The symptoms of methamphetamine (METH)-induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophrenia. Therefore, we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5-HT6 gene (HTR6) with METH-induced psychosis. METHOD: Using five tagging SNPs (rs6693503, rs1805054, rs4912138, rs3790757 and rs9659997), we conducted a genetic association analysis of case-control samples (197 METH-induced psychosis patients and 337 controls) in the Japanese population. The age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patients. RESULTS: rs6693503 was associated with METH-induced psychosis patients in the allele/genotype-wise analysis. Moreover, this association remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In the haplotype-wise analysis, we detected an association between two markers (rs6693503 and rs1805054) and three markers (rs6693503, rs1805054 and rs4912138) in HTR6 and METH-induced psychosis patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: HTR6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of METH-induced psychosis in the Japanese population.",0,0,1,0
"Protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patients. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with indomethacin. METHODS: Forty-five hospitalized elderly patients (> 65 years old) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin, 150 mg/day (Group A), or indomethacin 150 mg/day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg/day (Group B). Laboratory variables of renal function [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and electrolytes] were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days, until termination of the study (a period of at least 6 days). Response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain. RESULTS: Forty-two patients completed the study, 22 in Group A and 20 in Group B. BUN and creatinine increased by > 50% of baseline levels in 54 and 45% of Group A patients, respectively, compared to only 20 and 10% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). Potassium (K) increment of 0.6 mEq/l or more was observed in 50% of Group A, but in only 15% of Group B patients (p < 0.05). The mean increments in BUN, creatinine, and K were reduced by 63, 80, and 42%, respectively, in Group B patients compared to Group A. Response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. CONCLUSION: Hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dysfunction.

"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease: filling the bench-to-bedside gap. Levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the long-term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dyskinesias. Although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa-induced dyskinesias, their pathogenesis is still unclear. In recent years, evidence from animal models of Parkinson's disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post-receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dyskinetic movements.

"Cerebrospinal fluid penetration of high-dose daptomycin in suspected Staphylococcus aureus meningitis. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bacteremia with suspected MSSA meningitis treated with high-dose daptomycin assessed with concurrent serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations. CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness and presumed health-care-associated pneumonia shown on chest radiograph. Treatment was empirically initiated with vancomycin, levofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. Blood cultures revealed S. aureus susceptible to oxacillin. Empiric antibiotic treatment was narrowed to nafcillin on day 4. On day 8, the patient developed acute renal failure (serum creatinine 1.9 mg/dL, increased from 1.2 mg/dL the previous day and 0.8 mg/dL on admission). The patient's Glasgow Coma Score was 3, with normal findings shown on computed tomography scan of the head 72 hours following an episode of cardiac arrest on day 10. The patient experienced relapsing MSSA bacteremia on day 9, increasing the suspicion for a central nervous system (CNS) infection. Nafcillin was discontinued and daptomycin 9 mg/kg daily was initiated for suspected meningitis and was continued until the patient's death on day 16. Daptomycin serum and CSF trough concentrations were 11.21 ug/mL and 0.52 ug/mL, respectively, prior to the third dose. Lumbar puncture results were inconclusive and no further blood cultures were positive for MSSA. Creatine kinase levels were normal prior to daptomycin therapy and were not reassessed. DISCUSSION: Daptomycin was initiated in our patient secondary to possible nafcillin-induced acute interstitial nephritis and relapsing bacteremia. At a dose of 9 mg/kg, resultant penetration of 5% was higher than in previous reports, more consistent with inflamed meninges. CONCLUSIONS: High-dose daptomycin may be an alternative option for MSSA bacteremia with or without a CNS source in patients who have failed or cannot tolerate standard therapy. Further clinical evaluation in patients with confirmed meningitis is warranted.",0,1,1,0

"A single neurotoxic dose of methamphetamine induces a long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice. Methamphetamine (METH) triggers a disruption of the monoaminergic system and METH abuse leads to negative emotional states including depressive symptoms during drug withdrawal. However, it is currently unknown if the acute toxic dosage of METH also causes a long-lasting depressive phenotype and persistent monoaminergic deficits. Thus, we now assessed the depressive-like behaviour in mice at early and long-term periods following a single high METH dose (30 mg/kg, i.p.). METH did not alter the motor function and procedural memory of mice as assessed by swimming speed and escape latency to find the platform in a cued version of the water maze task. However, METH significantly increased the immobility time in the tail suspension test at 3 and 49 days post-administration. This depressive-like profile induced by METH was accompanied by a marked depletion of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission, indicated by a reduction in the levels of dopamine, DOPAC and HVA, tyrosine hydroxylase and serotonin, observed at both 3 and 49 days post-administration. In parallel, another neurochemical feature of depression--astroglial dysfunction--was unaffected in the cortex and the striatal levels of the astrocytic protein marker, glial fibrillary acidic protein, were only transiently increased at 3 days. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a single high dose of METH induces long-lasting depressive-like behaviour in mice associated with a persistent disruption of frontostriatal dopaminergic and serotonergic homoeostasis.",0,0,1,0
"Transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amphetamine. Following unilateral 6-OHDA induced SN lesion, a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral circling. In order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion, on amphetamine-induced rotational behavior. Three days post lesion, most rats circled predominantly contralaterally to the lesion. Such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration-induced breakdown of the DA pool, or lesion-induced increase of DA turnover in the spared neurons. A substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after lesioning, indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rotation. However, regardless of the duration of recovery (and irrespective of either lesion volume, amphetamine dose, or post-lesion motor exercise), amphetamine-induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed, and all rats circled ipsilaterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injections. These findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post-lesion DA pool contributing to contralateral rotation.",0,0,1,0

"Reduced progression of adriamycin nephropathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats treated by losartan. BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to investigate the antihypertensive effects of angiotensin II type-1 receptor blocker, losartan, and its potential in slowing down renal disease progression in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with adriamycin (ADR) nephropathy. METHODS: Six-month-old female SHR were randomly selected in six groups. Two control groups (SH(6), SH(12)) received vehicle. Groups ADR(6), ADR+LOS(6) and ADR(12), and ADR+LOS(12) received ADR (2 mg/kg/b.w. i.v.) twice in a 3-week interval. Group ADR+LOS(6) received losartan (10 mg/kg/b.w./day by gavages) for 6 weeks and group ADR+LOS(12) for 12 weeks after second injection of ADR. Animals were killed after 6 or 12 weeks, respectively. Haemodynamic measurements were performed on anaesthetized animals, blood and urine samples were taken for biochemical analysis and the left kidney was processed for morphological studies. RESULTS: Short-term losartan treatment, besides antihypertensive effect, improved glomerular filtration rate and ameliorated glomerulosclerosis resulting in decreased proteinuria. Prolonged treatment with losartan showed further reduction of glomerulosclerosis associated with reduced progression of tubular atrophy and interstitial fibrosis, thus preventing heavy proteinuria and chronic renal failure. Losartan reduced uraemia and increased urea clearance in advanced ADR nephropathy in SHR. Histological examination showed that losartan could prevent tubular atrophy, interstitial infiltration and fibrosis in ADR nephropathy.

"Perhexiline maleate and peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy has been noted as a complication of therapy with perhexiline maleate, a drug widely used in France (and in clinical trials in the United States) for the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris.

Improvement was noted with cessation of therapy. In a few cases the presence of active denervation signified a poor prognosis, with only slight improvement. The underlying mechanism causing the neuropathy is not yet fully known, although some evidence indicates that it may be a lipid storage process.",0,0,1,0

"Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) and glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency in a patient with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Molecular study of a new variant (G6PD Clinic) with markedly acidic pH optimum. A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) variant with severe erythrocytic G6PD deficiency and a unique pH optimum is described in a young patient with chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( CNSHA ) and familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy ( FAP ) . Chronic hemolysis was present in the absence of infections , oxidant drugs or ingestion of faba beans . Residual enzyme activity was about 2 . 6 % and 63 % of normal activity in erythrocytes and leucocytes , respectively . A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD in the patient to have normal electrophoretic mobility ( at pH 7 . 0 , 8 . 0 and 8 . 8 ) , normal apparent affinity for substrates ( Km , G6P and NADP ) and a slightly abnormal utilization of substrate analogues ( decreased deamino-NADP and increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization ) . Heat stability was found to be markedly decreased ( 8 % of residual activity after 20 min of incubation at 46 degrees C ) and a particular characteristic of this enzyme was a biphasic pH curve with a greatly increased activity at low pH . Although molecular characteristics of this variant closely resemble those of G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Duarte , it can be distinguished from these and all other previously reported variants by virtue of its unusual pH curve . Therefore the present variant has been designated G6PD Clinic to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described",0,0,1,0

"Acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of slimming pills containing anthraquinones. Chinese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical conditions. Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported, usually involving the use of aristolochic acids. We report a 23-year-old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives, extracted from Rhizoma Rhei (rhubarb). The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac. Renal pathology was that of hypocellular interstitial fibrosis. Spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the slimming pills, but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later. Although a causal relationship between the use of an anthraquinone-containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven, phytotherapy-associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure.",0,1,0,0
"Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy in Israel. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) is a neurodegenerative disease in which the lysosomal enzyme , Aryl sulfatase A ( ARSA ) is deficient . The disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and its frequency is estimated to be 1 / 40 , 000 live births . The gene of ARSA has been cloned and up to now eight mutations causing MLD have been reported . Another mutation , PD , leads to the deficiency of the enzyme in vitro ( pseudodeficiency ) without any known clinical effect . The PD mutation is frequent in all populations . In Israel , late infantile MLD was found to be very frequent in a small Jewish isolate , the Habbanite Jews ( 1 / 75 live births ) . The molecular analysis demonstrated that in the Habbanite population , the mutation occurred on an allele with the PD mutation . The loss of ARSA activity is due to a point mutation C > T leading to a change of proline to leucine . MLD is also frequent among Moslem Arabs in Jerusalem . The mutation is a transition G > A destroying the splice donor site of exon 2 . This mutation has been reported in patients with the late infantile MLD from different ethnic groups . The Christian Arabs in Israel also have a high incidence of the disease ( 1 / 10 , 000 live births ) ; the mutation in this population is still unknown .

"Sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine monotherapy. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, remains a major health problem in Asian countries. Recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers, although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to now. In this report, we encountered a patient with decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therapy. The patient was a 50-year-old woman. Previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient, thus this patient had been referred to our hospital. However, the administration of lamivudine, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, for 23 months dramatically improved her liver severity. During this period, no drug resistant mutant HBV emerged, and the serum HBV-DNA level was continuously suppressed. These virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinued. Moreover, both hepatitis B surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient. The administration of lamivudine to patients with HBV-related cirrhosis, like our present case, should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option, especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available.",0,1,0,1
"Naloxazone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory, temperature, and behavioral effects of morphine. Behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or naloxazone, an antagonist of high-affinity mu 1 opioid receptors. Pretreatment with naloxazone significantly blocked morphine analgesia, catalepsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high-affinity binding in brain membranes. Moreover, naloxazone significantly attenuated the morphine-induced hypotension and respiratory depression, whereas morphine-induced bradycardia was less affected. Results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine.",1,0,1,0

"Efficacy and safety of granisetron, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist, in the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by high-dose cisplatin. PURPOSE: To assess the antiemetic effects and safety profile of four different doses of granisetron (Kytril; SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, Philadelphia, PA) when administered as a single intravenous (IV) dose for prophylaxis of cisplatin-induced nausea and vomiting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred eighty-four chemotherapy-naive patients receiving high-dose cisplatin (81 to 120 mg/m2) were randomized to receive one of four granisetron doses (5, 10, 20, or 40 micrograms/kg) administered before chemotherapy. Patients were observed on an inpatient basis for 18 to 24 hours, and vital signs, nausea, vomiting, retching, and appetite were assessed. Safety analyses included incidence of adverse experiences and laboratory parameter changes. RESULTS: After granisetron doses of 5, 10, 20, and 40 micrograms/kg, a major response (< or = two vomiting or retching episodes, and no antiemetic rescue) was recorded in 23%, 57%, 58%, and 60% of patients, respectively, and a complete response (no vomiting or retching, and no antiemetic rescue) in 18%, 41%, 40%, and 47% of patients, respectively. There was a statistically longer time to first episode of nausea (P = .0015) and vomiting (P = .0001), and fewer patients were administered additional antiemetic medication in the 10-micrograms/kg dosing groups than in the 5-micrograms/kg dosing group. As granisetron dose increased, appetite return increased (P = .040). Headache was the most frequently reported adverse event (20%). CONCLUSION: A single 10-, 20-, or 40-micrograms/kg dose of granisetron was effective in controlling vomiting in 57% to 60% of patients who received cisplatin at doses greater than 81 mg/m2 and totally prevented vomiting in 40% to 47% of patients. There were no statistically significant differences in efficacy between the 10-micrograms/kg dose and the 20- and 40-micrograms/kg doses. Granisetron was well tolerated at all doses.",0,0,1,0
"Brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs, but they frequently cause dose-related cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dysfunction. We measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) to determine whether BNP might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a DNR-containing regimen. Cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemotherapies. The plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were measured at the time of radionuclide angiography. Three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. Five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemotherapy. The plasma levels of BNP in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit (40 pg/ml) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angiography. On the other hand, BNP did not increase in the patients without heart failure given DNR, even at more than 700 mg/m(2). The plasma level of ANP did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary results suggest that BNP may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity.",1,0,1,1

"Magnetic resonance volumetry of the cerebellum in epileptic patients after phenytoin overdosages. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between phenytoin medication and cerebellar atrophy in patients who had experienced clinical intoxication. Five females and 6 males, 21-59 years of age, were examined with a 1.5-T whole-body system using a circular polarized head coil. Conventional spin echo images were acquired in the sagittal and transverse orientation. In addition, we performed a high-resolution 3D gradient echo, T1-weighted sequences at a 1-mm slice thickness. The images were subsequently processed to obtain volumetric data for the cerebellum. Cerebellar volume for the patient group ranged between 67.66 and 131.08 ml (mean 108.9 ml). In addition 3D gradient echo data sets from 10 healthy male and 10 healthy female age-matched volunteers were used to compare cerebellar volumes. Using linear regression we found that no correlation exists between seizure duration, elevation of phenytoin serum levels and cerebellar volume. However, multiple regression for the daily dosage, duration of phenytoin treatment and cerebellar volume revealed a correlation of these parameters. We conclude that phenytoin overdosage does not necessarily result in cerebellar atrophy and it is unlikely that phenytoin medication was the only cause of cerebellar atrophy in the remaining patients. Quantitative morphometric studies of the cerebellum provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis of cerebellar disorders.",0,0,1,0

"The natural history of Vigabatrin associated visual field defects in patients electing to continue their medication. PURPOSE: To determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have Vigabatrin-associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure control. METHODS: All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years (range 5-12 years) were entered into a visual surveillance programme. Patients were followed up at 6-monthly intervals for not less than 18 months (range 18-43 months). In all, 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medication. Following already published methodology (Eye 2002; 16;567-571) monocular mean radial degrees (MRDs) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow-up. RESULTS: Mean right eye MRD at presentation was 36.98 degrees (range 22.25-51.0), compared to 38.40 degrees (range 22.5-49.75) after follow-up; P=0.338 unpaired t-test. Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment. CONCLUSION: Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication. These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Vigabatrin-associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose-dependent toxicity.",0,0,1,0

"Effect of increasing intraperitoneal infusion rates on bupropion hydrochloride-induced seizures in mice. BACKGROUND: It is not known if there is a relationship between input rate and incidence of bupropion-induced seizures. This is important, since different controlled release formulations of bupropion release the active drug at different rates. METHODS: We investigated the effect of varying the intraperitoneal infusion rates of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg, a known convulsive dose 50 (CD50), on the incidence and severity of bupropion-induced convulsions in the Swiss albino mice. A total of 69 mice, approximately 7 weeks of age, and weighing 21.0 to 29.1 g were randomly assigned to bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg treatment by intraperitoneal (IP) administration in 7 groups (9 to 10 animals per group). Bupropion HCl was infused through a surgically implanted IP dosing catheter with infusions in each group of 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, and 240 min. The number, time of onset, duration and the intensity of the convulsions or absence of convulsions were recorded. RESULTS: The results showed that IP administration of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg by bolus injection induced convulsions in 6 out of 10 mice (60% of convulsing mice) in group 1. Logistic regression analysis revealed that infusion time was significant (p = 0.0004; odds ratio = 0.974) and increasing the IP infusion time of bupropion HCl 120 mg/kg was associated with a 91% reduced odds of convulsions at infusion times of 15 to 90 min compared to bolus injection. Further increase in infusion time resulted in further reduction in the odds of convulsions to 99.8% reduction at 240 min. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the demonstration of an inverse relationship between infusion time of a fixed and convulsive dose of bupropion and the risk of convulsions in a prospective study is novel.",0,0,1,0

"Comparison of developmental toxicity of selective and non-selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors in CRL:(WI)WUBR Wistar rats--DFU and piroxicam study. BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are one of the most often ingested drugs during pregnancy. Unlike general toxicity data, their prenatal toxic effects were not extensively studied before. The aim of the experiment was to evaluate the developmental toxicity of the non-selective (piroxicam) and selective (DFU; 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furanon) COX-2 inhibitors. METHODS: Drugs were separately, orally once daily dosed to pregnant rats from day 8 to 21 (GD1=plug day). Doses were set at 0.3, 3.0 and 30.0mg/kg for piroxicam and 0.2, 2.0 and 20.0mg/kg for DFU. Fetuses were delivered on GD 21 and routinely examined. Comprehensive clinical and developmental measurements were done. The pooled statistical analysis for ventricular septal (VSD) and midline (MD) defects was performed for rat fetuses exposed to piroxicam, selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitor based on present and historic data. RESULTS: Maternal toxicity, intrauterine growth retardation, and increase of external and skeletal variations were found in rats treated with the highest dose of piroxicam. Decrease of fetal length was the only signs of the DFU developmental toxicity observed in pups exposed to the highest compound dose. Lack of teratogenicity was found in piroxicam and DFU-exposed groups. Prenatal exposure to non-selective COX inhibitors increases the risk of VSD and MD when compared to historic control but not with selective COX-2 inhibitors. CONCLUSION: Both selective and non-selective COX-2 inhibitors were toxic for rats fetuses when administered in the highest dose. Unlike DFU, piroxicam was also highly toxic to the dams. Prenatal exposure to selective COX-2 inhibitors does not increase the risk of ventricular septal and midline defects in rat when compared to non-selective drugs and historic control.",0,1,1,0
"Urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase--a marker of tubular damage?. BACKGROUND: Although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction, an increased urinary N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cells. METHODS: Puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) was administered to Sprague Dawley rats to induce proteinuria. Total protein, albumin, NAG activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 days. The morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three, four, six, eight and thirty three and the NAG isoenzyme patterns on days zero, four, eight and thirty three. RESULTS: Following intravenous PAN urine volume and urine NAG activity increased significantly by day two, but returned to normal by day four. After day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin, total protein excretion and NAG activity. Electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four onwards. Protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four. Peak urine NAG activity and a change in NAG isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and NAG droplets (day six onwards). CONCLUSIONS: This animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine NAG activity, occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cells. Urine NAG activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage.",0,1,0,0

"Proliferation-related expression of p19/nm23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase. High level expression of the nm23-H1 gene , which encodes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase , has been found to correlate with diminished metastasis in some tumors but not in others . We have previously identified the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels and have designated it p19 / nm23 . In neuroblastoma , higher levels of p19 / nm23 , which are associated with amplification of the N-myc oncogene , large tumor mass , and metastasis , were observed in advanced stage tumors compared with limited stage disease . Because of the variable expression of nm23-H1 in different tumors , we have investigated the relationship between amounts of the protein and cell proliferation . The levels of p19 / nm23 were compared between resting and mitotically stimulated normal human PBLs and in leukemia cells . The amount of p19 / nm23 increased in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation and paralleled the increase in DNA synthesis . In leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia , p19 / nm23 levels were also increased relative to resting normal lymphocytes . Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin , which inhibits proliferation , blocked the increase in p19 / nm23 ; treatment of the leukemia cell line HL-60 with dimethylsulfoxide , which induces terminal differentiation , resulted in diminished levels of p19 / nm23 .

"Early infections in kidney, heart, and liver transplant recipients on cyclosporine. Eighty-one renal, seventeen heart, and twenty-four liver transplant patients were followed for infection. Seventeen renal patients received azathioprine (Aza) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine-and-prednisone-treated renal transplant patients. All others received cyclosporine and prednisone. The randomized Aza patients had more overall infections (P less than 0.05) and more nonviral infections (P less than 0.02) than the randomized cyclosporine patients. Heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the Aza renal patients. There were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or Aza, but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant deaths. Renal patients on cyclosporine had the fewest bacteremias. Analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients, intrathoracic infections in heart patients, and urinary tract infections in renal patients. Pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine-treated renal patients than in Aza-treated patients (P less than 0.05). Aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups (P less than 0.005), and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant group.

"Force overflow and levodopa-induced dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease. We assessed force coordination of the hand in Parkinson's disease and its relationship to motor complications of levodopa therapy, particularly to levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We studied two groups of Parkinson's disease patients with (Parkinson's disease + LID, n = 23) and without levodopa-induced dyskinesias (Parkinson's disease - LID, n = 10), and age-matched healthy controls. The motor score of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, a dyskinesia score and force in a grip-lift paradigm were assessed ON and OFF levodopa. A pathological increase of forces was seen in ON-state in Parkinson's disease + LID only. In Parkinson's disease + LID, the force involved in pressing down the object before lifting was significantly increased by levodopa (by 61%, P < 0.05). An overshooting of peak grip force by 51% (P < 0.05) and of static grip force by 45% (P < 0.01) was observed in the ON- compared with the OFF-drug condition. In contrast, no excessive force was found in Parkinson's disease - LID. Peak grip force in ON-state was 140% (P < 0.05) higher in Parkinson's disease + LID than in Parkinson's disease - LID, while static grip force was increased by 138% (P < 0.01) between groups. Severity of peak-dose dyskinesias was strongly correlated with grip force in ON-state (r = 0.79 with peak force, P < 0.01). No correlation was observed between forces and the motor score as well as with the daily dose of dopaminergic medication. Force excess was only observed in patients with LID and motor fluctuations. A close relationship was seen between the overshooting of forces and dyskinesias in the ON-drug condition. We postulate that both LID and grip force excess share common pathophysiological mechanisms related to motor fluctuations.",0,0,1,0
"Adenomatous polyposis coli and a cytogenetic deletion of chromosome 5 resulting from a maternal intrachromosomal insertion. We present the clinical and laboratory findings in an institutionalised adult patient originally referred for autism . A high risk of colorectal cancer was predicted when an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 5 , del ( 5 ) ( q15q22 . 3 ) , was detected in her lymphocytes and deletion of the MCC and APC genes confirmed by molecular analysis . Adenomatous polyposis coli and carcinoma of the rectum were subsequently diagnosed in the patient . She was profoundly mentally retarded , autistic , and had minor dysmorphic features consistent with those of previous patients with similar deletions . The deletion arose as a result of recombination within the small insertion loop formed at meiosis by the direct insertion ( dir ins ( 5 ) ( q22 . 3q14 . 2q15 ) ) found in the patients mother . This family further confirms the cytogenetic mapping of both MCC and APC genes to 5q22 and comparison with other recent cases suggests that both genes and their closely linked markers lie within the 5q22 . 1 subband",0,0,1,1

"Pure red cell aplasia, toxic dermatitis and lymphadenopathy in a patient taking diphenylhydantoin. A patient taking diphenylhydantoin for 3 weeks developed a generalized skin rash, lymphadenopathy and pure red cell aplasia. After withdrawal of the pharmacon all symptoms disappeared spontaneously. Skin rash is a well-known complication of diphenylhydantoin treatment as is benign and malignant lymphadenopathy. Pure red cell aplasia associated with diphenylhydantoin medication has been reported in 3 patients. The exact mechanism by which diphenylhydantoin exerts its toxic effects is not known. In this patient the time relation between the ingestion of diphenylhydantoin and the occurrence of the skin rash, lymphadenopathy and pure red cell aplasia is very suggestive of a direct connection.",0,0,1,0

"Role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rats. 1. Glucocorticoid-induced hypertension (GC-HT) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide-redox imbalance. 2. We studied the role of xanthine oxidase (XO), which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species, in dexamethasone-induced hypertension (dex-HT). 3. Thirty male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups: saline, dexamethasone (dex), allopurinol plus saline, and allopurinol plus dex. 4. Systolic blood pressures (SBP) and bodyweights were recorded each alternate day. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity, and serum urate to assess XO inhibition. 5. Dex increased SBP (110 +/- 2-126 +/- 3 mmHg; P < 0.001) and decreased thymus (P < 0.001) and bodyweights (P"" < 0.01). Allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 +/- 5 to 30 +/- 3 micromol/L (P < 0.001) in saline and from 84 +/- 13 to 28 +/- 2 micromol/L in dex-treated (P < 0.01) groups. 6. Allopurinol did not prevent dex-HT. This, together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocorticotrophic hormone induced hypertension, suggests that XO activity is not a major determinant of GC-HT in the rat.",1,0,0,0

"Participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. The effects of microinjection of clonidine (1-10 micrograms in 1 microliter) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Intramedullary administration of clonidine, but not saline vehicle, caused a dose-dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate. The clonidine-induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection, but not bilateral vagotomy. On the other hand, the clonidine-induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy, but not spinal transection. Furthermore, selective destruction of the spinal 5-HT nerves, produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats. The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine-induced hypotension and bradycardia. The induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity, whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity.",1,0,1,0

"Mutations associated with lamivudine-resistance in therapy-na  ve hepatitis B virus (HBV) infected patients with and without HIV co-infection: implications for antiretroviral therapy in HBV and HIV co-infected South African patients. This was an exploratory study to investigate lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (HBV) strains in selected lamivudine-na  ve HBV carriers with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection in South African patients. Thirty-five lamivudine-na  ve HBV infected patients with or without HIV co-infection were studied: 15 chronic HBV mono-infected patients and 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The latter group was further sub-divided into 13 occult HBV (HBsAg-negative) and 7 overt HBV (HBsAg- positive) patients. HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HIV 1/2 were determined as part of routine diagnosis using Axsym assays (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago, IL). Serum samples were PCR amplified with HBV reverse transcriptase (RT) primers, followed by direct sequencing across the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the major catalytic region in the C domain of the HBV RT enzyme. HBV viral load was performed with Amplicor HBV Monitor test v2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Penzberg, Germany). HBV lamivudine-resistant strains were detected in 3 of 15 mono-infected chronic hepatitis B patients and 10 of 20 HBV-HIV co-infected patients. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first report of HBV lamivudine-resistant strains in therapy-na  ve HBV-HIV co-infected patients. The HBV viral loads for mono-infected and co-infected patients ranged from 3.32 x 10(2) to 3.82 x 10(7) and <200 to 4.40 x 10(3) copies/ml, respectively. It remains to be seen whether such pre-existing antiviral mutations could result in widespread emergence of HBV resistant strains when lamivudine-containing highly active antiretroviral (ARV) treatment (HAART) regimens become widely applied in South Africa, as this is likely to have potential implications in the management of HBV-HIV co-infected patients.",0,1,0,0

"Recent preclinical and clinical studies with the thymidylate synthase inhibitor N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717). CB 3717, N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, is a tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS) whose cytotoxicity is mediated solely through the inhibition of this enzyme. Recent preclinical studies have focused on the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates. Following a 12-hour exposure of L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717, 30% of the extractable radioactivity could be accounted for as CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate, as determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses. As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra- and pentaglutamate are 26-, 87-, 119- and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, and their formation may, therefore, be an important determinant of CB 3717 cytotoxicity. In early clinical studies with CB 3717, activity has been seen in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. This latter effect is thought to be due to drug precipitation within the renal tubule as a result of the poor solubility of CB 3717 under acidic conditions. In an attempt to overcome this problem, a clinical trial of CB 3717 administered with alkaline diuresis is under way. Preliminary results at 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest that a reduction in nephrotoxicity may have been achieved with only 1 instance of renal toxicity in 10 patients. Hepatotoxicity and malaise are again the most frequent side effects. Evidence of antitumor activity has been seen in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic investigations have shown that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma levels or urinary excretion and that satisfactory urinary alkalinization can be readily achieved.",0,1,0,1

"Drug-associated acute-onset vanishing bile duct and Stevens-Johnson syndromes in a child. Acute vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare but established cause of progressive cholestasis in adults, is most often drug or toxin related, and is of unknown pathogenesis. It has not been reported previously in children. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a well-recognized immune complex-mediated hypersensitivity reaction that affects all age groups, is drug or infection induced, and has classic systemic, mucosal, and dermatologic manifestations. A previously healthy child who developed acute, severe, rapidly progressive vanishing bile duct syndrome shortly after Stevens-Johnson syndrome is described; this was temporally associated with ibuprofen use. Despite therapy with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisone, and then tacrolimus, her cholestatic disease was unrelenting, with cirrhosis shown by biopsy 6 months after presentation. This case documents acute drug-related vanishing bile duct syndrome in the pediatric age group and suggests shared immune mechanisms in the pathogenesis of both Stevens-Johnson syndrome and vanishing bile duct syndrome.",0,1,1,0

"Malignant neoplasms in the families of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) is an autosomal recessive syndrome associated with a greatly increased incidence of malignant neoplasms in homozygous affected individuals . Heterozygotes for the gene for A-T are thought to comprise about 1 % of the general population and , therefore , it is important to know whether this gene also predisposes the heterozygous carrier to cancers . Heterozygous carriers of this gene are common among the close relatives of patients with A-T , although individual carriers cannot be identified by any clinical criterion or laboratory test . For this reason , we compared the incidence of death from malignant neoplasms in 2 families of patients with A-T to that expected in a random sample of the general population . There were 59 deaths from malignant neoplasms in relatives dying before age 75 , compared to 42 . 6 expected ( p less than 0 . 02 ) . For A-T heterozygotes younger than age 45 , the risk of dying from a malignant neoplasm was estimated to be greater than 5 times the risk for the general population . A-T heterozygotes may comprise more than 5 % of all persons dying from a cancer before age 45 .

Groups were matched with respect to age, gender, and seizure frequency. All patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function (wide-field multifocal electroretinography) and conventional visual field testing (static perimetry). Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB, 43% of patients who previously took VGB, and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB. Assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48% of current VGB users and 22% of prior VGB users, but in none of the patients without previous exposure to VGB. Bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population, irrespective of drug history. Assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with VGB.",0,0,1,0

At day 833 after the transplantation, he was diagnosed with PTLD (post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). During induction therapy, he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was performed. Subsequent HD-MTX therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodialysis.

"A randomized, placebo-controlled dose-comparison trial of haloperidol for psychosis and disruptive behaviors in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and side effects of two doses of haloperidol and placebo in the treatment of psychosis and disruptive behaviors in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: In a 6-week random-assignment, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (phase A), haloperidol, 2-3 mg/day (standard dose), and haloperidol, 0.50-0.75 mg/day (low dose), were compared in 71 outpatients with Alzheimer's disease. For the subsequent 6-week double-blind crossover phase (phase B), patients taking standard- or low-dose haloperidol were switched to placebo, and patients taking placebo were randomly assigned to standard- or low-dose haloperidol. RESULTS: For the 60 patients who completed phase A, standard-dose haloperidol was efficacious and superior to both low-dose haloperidol and placebo for scores on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis factor and on psychomotor agitation. Response rates according to three sets of criteria were greater with the standard dose (55%-60%) than the low dose (25%-35%) and placebo (25%-30%). The advantage of standard dose over low dose was replicated in phase B. In phase A, extrapyramidal signs tended to be greater with the standard dose than in the other two conditions, primarily because of a subgroup (20%) who developed moderate to severe signs. Low-dose haloperidol did not differ from placebo on any measure of efficacy or side effects. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated a favorable therapeutic profile for haloperidol in doses of 2-3 mg/day, although a subgroup developed moderate to severe extrapyramidal signs. A starting dose of 1 mg/day with gradual, upward dose titration is recommended. The narrow therapeutic window observed with haloperidol may also apply to other neuroleptics used in Alzheimer's disease patients with psychosis and disruptive behaviors.",0,0,1,0
"Less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volume. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once-per-day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules. Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level, creatinine clearance, urine volume, and maximum osmolality. RESULTS: Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes. The dosing schedule, duration of lithium treatment, and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance. CONCLUSIONS: Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose. Lithium-induced polyuria seems to be related to extrarenal as well as to renal effects.",0,1,1,0
"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. Sixty-two patients with a heparin-induced thrombocytopenia are reported. Clinical manifestations of this disorder include hemorrhage or, more frequently, thromboembolic events in patients receiving heparin. Laboratory testing has revealed a falling platelet count, increased resistance to heparin, and aggregation of platelets by the patient's plasma when heparin is added. Immunologic testing has demonstrated the presence of a heparin-dependent platelet membrane antibody. The 20 deaths, 52 hemorrhagic and thromboembolic complications, and 21 surgical procedures to manage the complications confirm the seriousness of the disorder. Specific risk factors have not been identified; therefore, all patients receiving heparin should be monitored. If the platelet count falls to less than 100,000/mm3, while the patient is receiving heparin, platelet aggregation testing, using the patient's plasma, is indicated. Management consists of cessation of heparin, platelet anti-aggregating agents, and alternate forms of anticoagulation when indicated.",0,0,1,0
"Central cardiovascular effects of AVP and ANP in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin (AVP) and of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) on control of arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) in normotensive (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. Three series of experiments were performed on 30 WKY and 30 SHR, chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle (LV) and arterial and venous catheters. MAP and HR were monitored before and after i.v. injections of either vehicle or 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP and 25, 125 and 500 ng of ANP. Sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex (CCB), expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure (SAP) and HR period (HRp) during phenylephrine (Phe)-induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside (SN)-induced hypotension. CCB was measured before and after administration of either vehicle, AVP, ANP, or both peptides together. Increases of MAP occurred after LV administration of 1, 10 and 50 ng of AVP in WKY and of 10 and 50 ng in SHR. ANP did not cause significant changes in MAP in both strains as compared to vehicle, but it abolished AVP-induced MAP increase in WKY and SHR. CCB was reduced in WKY and SHR after LV administration of AVP during SN-induced hypotension. In SHR but not in WKY administration of ANP, AVP and ANP + AVP decreased CCB during Phe-induced MAP elevation. The results indicate that centrally applied AVP and ANP exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in WKY and SHR and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system.",1,0,0,0

"Prophylactic lidocaine in the early phase of suspected myocardial infarction. Four hundred two patients with suspected myocardial infarction seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double-blind randomized trial of lidocaine vs placebo. During the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia among the 204 patients with acute myocardial infarction was low, 1.5%. Lidocaine, given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously, did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia, although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine (p less than 0.05). The average plasma lidocaine level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a myocardial infarction was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute infarction. The mean plasma lidocaine level of patients on beta-blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking agents. During the 1-hour study period, the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the lidocaine group, hypotension occurred in 11 patients, nine of whom had received lidocaine, and four patients died from asystole, three of whom had had lidocaine.

"Molecular analysis in familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: early diagnosis of an asymptomatic carrier. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an inherited deficiency of the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) and is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait . In the present study we have analyzed the AVP-neurophysin II ( AVP-NPII ) gene in a Spanish kindred . Studies were performed on seven members ( four clinically affected ) of the family . Patients were diagnosed at the Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon ( Madrid , Spain ) . The entire coding region of the AVP-NPII gene of all family members was amplified by PCR and sequenced . All affected individuals presented a missense mutation ( G1757-- > A ) that replaces glycine at position 23 with arginine within the NPII domain . The substitution was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis and was present in heterozygosis . Additionally , one of the asymptomatic relatives ( a girl 8 months old at the time of study ) was identified as carrier of the same mutation and developed the disease 3 months later . The alteration found in the second exon of the gene in this family seems to be responsible for the disease , as all individuals harboring the mutation had been previously diagnosed or have eventually developed FNDI . Identification of the molecular defect underlying FNDI in affected families is a powerful tool for early asymptomatic diagnosis in infants . .",0,0,1,0

"Increased anxiogenic effects of caffeine in panic disorders. The effects of oral administration of caffeine (10 mg/kg) on behavioral ratings, somatic symptoms, blood pressure and plasma levels of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (MHPG) and cortisol were determined in 17 healthy subjects and 21 patients meeting DSM-III criteria for agoraphobia with panic attacks or panic disorder. Caffeine produced significantly greater increases in subject-rated anxiety, nervousness, fear, nausea, palpitations, restlessness, and tremors in the patients compared with healthy subjects. In the patients, but not the healthy subjects, these symptoms were significantly correlated with plasma caffeine levels. Seventy-one percent of the patients reported that the behavioral effects of caffeine were similar to those experienced during panic attacks. Caffeine did not alter plasma MHPG levels in either the healthy subjects or patients. Caffeine increased plasma cortisol levels equally in the patient and healthy groups. Because caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist, these results suggest that some panic disorder patients may have abnormalities in neuronal systems involving adenosine. Patients with anxiety disorders may benefit by avoiding caffeine-containing foods and beverages.",1,0,1,0

"Recombinations in individuals homozygous by descent localize the Friedreich ataxia locus in a cloned 450-kb interval. The locus for Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , a severe neurodegenerative disease , is tightly linked to markers D9S5 and D9S15 , and analysis of rare recombination events has suggested the order cen-FRDA-D9S5-D9S15-qter . We report here the construction of a YAC contig extending 800 kb centromeric to D9S5 and the isolation of five new microsatellite markers from this region . In order to map these markers with respect to the FRDA locus , all within a 1-cM confidence interval , we sought to increase the genetic information of available FRDA families by considering homozygosity by descent and association with founder haplotypes in isolated populations . This approach allowed us to identify one phase-known recombination and one probable historic recombination on haplotypes from Reunion Island patients , both of which place three of the five markers proximal to FRDA . This represents the first identification of close FRDA flanking markers on the centromeric side . The two other markers allowed us to narrow the breakpoint of a previously identified distal recombination that is > 180 kb from D9S5 ( 26P ) . Taken together , the results place the FRDA locus in a 450-kb interval , which is small enough for direct search of candidate genes . A detailed rare cutter restriction map and a cosmid contig covering this interval were constructed and should facilitate the search of genes in this region . .",0,0,1,0

"atm and p53 cooperate in apoptosis and suppression of tumorigenesis, but not in resistance to acute radiation toxicity. Mutations in atm and p53 cause the human cancer-associated diseases ataxia-telangiectasia and Li-Fraumeni syndrome , respectively . The two genes are believed to interact in a number of pathways , including regulation of DNA damage-induced cell-cycle checkpoints , apoptosis and radiation sensitivity , and cellular proliferation . Atm-null mice , as well as those null for p53 , develop mainly T-cell lymphomas , supporting the view that these genes have similar roles in thymocyte development . To study the interactions of these two genes on an organismal level , we bred mice heterozygous for null alleles of both atm and p53 to produce all genotypic combinations . Mice doubly null for atm and p53 exhibited a dramatic acceleration of tumour formation relative to singly null mice , indicating that both genes collaborate in a significant manner to prevent tumorigenesis . With respect to their roles in apoptosis , loss of atm rendered thymocytes only partly resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis , whereas additional loss of p53 engendered complete resistance . This implies that the irradiation-induced atm and p53 apoptotic pathways are not completely congruent . Finally-and in contrast to prior predictions-atm and p53 do not appear to interact in acute radiation toxicity , suggesting a separate atm effector pathway for this DNA damage response and having implications for the prognosis and treatment of human tumours . .",0,0,1,1
"Absence of PKC-alpha attenuates lithium-induced nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Lithium, an effective antipsychotic, induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in  40% of patients. The decreased capacity to concentrate urine is likely due to lithium acutely disrupting the cAMP pathway and chronically reducing urea transporter (UT-A1) and water channel (AQP2) expression in the inner medulla. Targeting an alternative signaling pathway, such as PKC-mediated signaling, may be an effective method of treating lithium-induced polyuria. PKC-alpha null mice (PKCa KO) and strain-matched wild type (WT) controls were treated with lithium for 0, 3 or 5 days. WT mice had increased urine output and lowered urine osmolality after 3 and 5 days of treatment whereas PKCa KO mice had no change in urine output or concentration. Western blot analysis revealed that AQP2 expression in medullary tissues was lowered after 3 and 5 days in WT mice; however, AQP2 was unchanged in PKCa KO. Similar results were observed with UT-A1 expression. Animals were also treated with lithium for 6 weeks. Lithium-treated WT mice had 19-fold increased urine output whereas treated PKCa KO animals had a 4-fold increase in output. AQP2 and UT-A1 expression was lowered in 6 week lithium-treated WT animals whereas in treated PKCa KO mice, AQP2 was only reduced by 2-fold and UT-A1 expression was unaffected. Urinary sodium, potassium and calcium were elevated in lithium-fed WT but not in lithium-fed PKCa KO mice. Our data show that ablation of PKCa preserves AQP2 and UT-A1 protein expression and localization in lithium-induced NDI, and prevents the development of the severe polyuria associated with lithium therapy.",0,1,0,0

"Regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and apoptotic pathways by betaine attenuates isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial injury in rats. The present study was designed to investigate the cardioprotective effects of betaine on acute myocardial ischemia induced experimentally in rats focusing on regulation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and apoptotic pathways as the potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Male Sprague Dawley rats were treated with betaine (100, 200, and 400 mg/kg) orally for 40 days. Acute myocardial ischemic injury was induced in rats by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg), for two consecutive days. Serum cardiac marker enzyme, histopathological variables and expression of protein levels were analyzed. Oral administration of betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) significantly reduced the level of cardiac marker enzyme in the serum and prevented left ventricular remodeling. Western blot analysis showed that isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 was maintained or further enhanced by betaine treatment in myocardium. Furthermore, betaine (200 and 400 mg/kg) treatment increased the ventricular expression of Bcl-2 and reduced the level of Bax, therefore causing a significant increase in the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The protective role of betaine on myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examination. In summary, our results showed that betaine pretreatment attenuated isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial ischemia via the regulation of STAT3 and apoptotic pathways.",1,0,0,0

"Risk of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy in cancer patients who received continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil with the complication of dehydration and infection. From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients who had 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy related to continuous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) were identified. None of the patients had decompensated liver disease. Onset of hyperammonemic encephalopathy varied from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after the initiation of chemotherapy. Plasma ammonium level ranged from 248 to 2387 microg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 microg%). Among the 32 episodes, 26 (81%) had various degrees of azotemia, 18 (56%) occurred during bacterial infections and 14 (44%) without infection occurred during periods of dehydration. Higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were seen in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients receiving high daily doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) of 5-FU (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). In 25 out of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status returned to normal within 2 days after adequate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy can occur in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU. Azotemia, body fluid insufficiency and bacterial infections were frequently found in these patients. It is therefore important to recognize this condition in patients receiving continuous infusion of 5-FU.",0,1,0,1
"Ceftriaxone-associated biliary pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients. It is well known that ceftriaxone leads to pseudolithiasis in some patients. Clinical and experimental studies also suggest that situations causing gallbladder dysfunction, such as fasting, may have a role for the development of pseudolithiasis. In this study, we prospectively evaluated the incidence and clinical importance of pseudolithiasis in paediatric surgical patients receiving ceftriaxone treatment, who often had to fast in the post-operative period. Fifty children who were given ceftriaxone were evaluated by serial abdominal sonograms. Of those, 13 (26%) developed biliary pathology. Comparison of the patients with or without pseudolithiasis revealed no significant difference with respect to age, sex, duration of the treatment and starvation variables.

"The role of nitric oxide in convulsions induced by lindane in rats. Lindane is an organochloride pesticide and scabicide. It evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of GABA(A) receptors. Nitric oxide (NO), gaseous neurotransmitter, has contradictor role in epileptogenesis due to opposite effects of L-arginine, precursor of NO syntheses (NOS), and L-NAME (NOS inhibitor) observed in different epilepsy models. The aim of the current study was to determine the effects of NO on the behavioral and EEG characteristics of lindane-induced epilepsy in male Wistar albino rats. The administration of L-arginine (600, 800 and 1000 mg/kg, i.p.) in dose-dependent manner significantly increased convulsion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convulsion elicited by lower lindane dose (4 mg/kg, i.p.). On the contrary, pretreatment with L-NAME (500, 700 and 900 mg/kg, i.p.) decreased convulsion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convulsion following injection with a convulsive dose of lindane (8 mg/kg, i.p.). EEG analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in EEG of rats receiving l-arginine prior to lindane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with L-NAME. These results support the conclusion that NO plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of lindane seizures.",0,0,1,0
"Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide (NO) deficiency: focus on venous function. Loss of endothelial cell-derived nitric oxide (NO) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction. Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO, however, involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity. These include augmented endothelin-1 (ET-1) release, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and elevated tissue oxidative stress. We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle (venomotor) tone plays a role in Nomega-nitro-L-arginine (LNNA) hypertension through these mechanisms. Rats were treated with the NO synthase inhibitor LNNA (0.5 g/L in drinking water) for 2 weeks. Mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 +/- 2 mm Hg in control and 194 +/- 5 mm Hg in LNNA rats (P<0.05). Carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contraction. Maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from LNNA compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to ET-1 was significantly reduced (54% control). Maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine (37% control) also was reduced but no change in response to ET-1 was observed. Mean circulatory filling pressure, an in vivo measure of venomotor tone, was not elevated in LNNA hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after LNNA. The superoxide scavenger tempol (30, 100, and 300 micromol kg(-1), IV) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose-dependent decrease in LNNA rats (-18 +/- 8, -26 +/- 15, and -54 +/- 11 mm Hg). Similarly, ganglionic blockade with hexamethonium caused a significantly greater fall in LNNA hypertensive rats (76 +/- 9 mm Hg) compared with control rats (35 +/- 10 mm Hg). Carotid arteries, vena cava, and sympathetic ganglia from LNNA rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rats. These data suggest that while NO deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels, the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension.",1,0,1,0

"ATM phosphorylates p95/nbs1 in an S-phase checkpoint pathway. The rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) , caused by mutations in the ATM gene , and Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) , with mutations in the p95 / nbs1 gene , share a variety of phenotypic abnormalities such as chromosomal instability , radiation sensitivity and defects in cell-cycle checkpoints in response to ionizing radiation . The ATM gene encodes a protein kinase that is activated by ionizing radiation or radiomimetic drugs , whereas p95 / nbs1 is part of a protein complex that is involved in responses to DNA double-strand breaks . Here , because of the similarities between AT and NBS , we evaluated the functional interactions between ATM and p95 / nbs1 . Activation of the ATM kinase by ionizing radiation and induction of ATM-dependent responses in NBS cells indicated that p95 / nbs1 may not be required for signalling to ATM after ionizing radiation . However , p95 / nbs1 was phosphorylated on serine 343 in an ATM-dependent manner in vitro and in vivo after ionizing radiation . A p95 / nbs1 construct mutated at the ATM phosphorylation site abrogated an S-phase checkpoint induced by ionizing radiation in normal cells and failed to compensate for this functional deficiency in NBS cells . These observations link ATM and p95 / nbs1 in a common signalling pathway and provide an explanation for phenotypic similarities in these two diseases . .",0,0,1,0

Acute normal tissue toxicities (i.e., leukopenia and thrombocytopenia) and late normal tissue toxicities (i.e., myocardial and kidney injury) were evaluated by functional/physiological assays and by morphological techniques. Whole body hyperthermia (120 min at 41.5 degrees C) enhanced both Adriamycin-mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effects.

"Co-carcinogenic effect of retinyl acetate on forestomach carcinogenesis of male F344 rats induced with butylated hydroxyanisole. The potential modifying effect of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced rat forestomach tumorigenesis was examined. Male F344 rats, 5 weeks of age, were maintained on diet containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with RA at various concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In groups given 2% BHA, although marked hyperplastic changes of the forestomach epithelium were observed in all animals, co-administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P less than 0.05) increased the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, one rat with carcinoma) in the group given RA-free water. In rats given 1% BHA, RA co-administered at a dose of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2 or 0.25% showed a dose-dependent enhancing effect on the development of the BHA-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all papillomas, were induced in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. RA alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach.

"A novel, multiple symptom model of obsessive-compulsive-like behaviors in animals. BACKGROUND: Current animal models of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) typically involve acute, drug-induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stereotypies or anxiety. None of these current models demonstrate multiple OCD-like behaviors. METHODS: Neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adulthood. RESULTS: Clomipramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety (elevated plus maze and marble burying), behavioral inflexibility (perseveration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning), working memory impairment (e.g., win-shift paradigm), hoarding, and corticostriatal dysfunction. Dopamine D2 receptors were elevated in the striatum, whereas serotonin 2C, but not serotonin 1A, receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an OCD-like profile in animals. Moreover, these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to OCD. This novel model of OCD demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease-like systems permanently, which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders.",0,0,1,0

"Effect of alkylxanthines on gentamicin-induced acute renal failure in the rat. Adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure (ARF). In the present study, the effects of three alkylxanthines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8-phenyltheophylline, theophylline and enprofylline, were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin (200 mg kg-1). Renal function was assessed by biochemical (plasma urea and creatinine), functional (urine analysis and [3H]inulin and [14C]p-aminohippuric acid clearances) and morphological (degree of necrosis) indices. The various drug treatments produced improvements in some, but not all, measurements of renal function. However, any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle (polyethylene glycol and NaOH). The lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkylxanthines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little, if any, pathophysiological role in gentamicin-induced ARF.",0,1,0,0

Yeast knockout models , and histological and biochemical data from patient heart biopsies or autopsies indicate that the frataxin defect causes a specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation leading to the pathological changes . Affected human tissues are rarely available to further examine this hypothesis . To study the mechanism of the disease , we generated a mouse model by deletion of exon 4 leading to inactivation of the Frda gene product . We show that homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality a few days after implantation , demonstrating an important role for frataxin during early development . These results suggest that the milder phenotype in humans is due to residual frataxin expression associated with the expansion mutations . Surprisingly , in the frataxin knockout mouse , no iron accumulation was observed during embryonic resorption , suggesting that cell death could be due to a mechanism independent of iron accumulation . .",1,0,1,0

"Chronic effects of a novel synthetic anthracycline derivative (SM-5887) on normal heart and doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy in beagle dogs. This study was designed to investigate the chronic cardiotoxic potential of SM-5887 and a possible deteriorating effect of SM-5887 on low-grade cardiotoxicity pre-induced by doxorubicin in beagle dogs. In the chronic treatment, beagle dogs of each sex were given intravenously once every 3 weeks, either a sublethal dose of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg). The experiment was terminated 3 weeks after the ninth dosing. Animals which received over six courses of doxorubicin demonstrated the electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, decrease of blood pressure and high-grade histopathological cardiomyopathy, while animals which were terminally sacrificed after the SM-5887 administration did not show any changes in ECG, blood pressure and histopathological examinations. To examine a possibly deteriorating cardiotoxic effect of SM-5887, low-grade cardiomyopathy was induced in dogs by four courses of doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg). Nine weeks after pre-treatment, dogs were given four courses of either doxorubicin (1.5 mg/kg) or SM-5887 (2.5 mg/kg) once every 3 weeks. The low-grade cardiotoxic changes were enhanced by the additional doxorubicin treatment. On the contrary, the SM-5887 treatment did not progress the grade of cardiomyopathy. In conclusion, SM-5887 does not have any potential of chronic cardiotoxicity and deteriorating effect on doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in dogs.",1,0,0,0

"Different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholestasis. Hepatocyte tight junctions (TJs), the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces, play a key role in bile formation. Although hepatocyte TJs are impaired in cholestasis, attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte TJ damage by freeze-fracture electron microscopy have produced limited information. Recently, several TJ-associated proteins like ZO-1 and 7H6 have been identified and characterized. Immunolocalization of 7H6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeability. We used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by ethinyl estradiol (EE) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation (BDL) to precisely determine the site of TJ damage. Alterations in hepatocyte TJs were assessed by double-immunolabeling for 7H6 and ZO-1 using a confocal laser scanning microscope. In control rats, immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 colocalized to outline bile canaliculi in a continuous fashion. In contrast, 7H6 and ZO-1 immunostaining was more discontinuous, outlining the bile canaliculi after BDL. Immunostaining for 7H6, not ZO-1, decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the submembranous cytoplasm of periportal hepatocytes after BDL. After EE treatment, changes in immunostaining for 7H6 and ZO-1 were similar to those seen in periportal hepatocytes after BDL, but distributed more diffusely throughout the lobule. This study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte TJs occurs heterogenously in the liver lobule after BDL and suggests that BDL and EE treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability.",0,1,0,0
"Hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient. We report a case of hypotension, bradycardia, and asystole after intravenous administration of high-dose methylprednisolone in a 73-year-old patient who underwent electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring throughout the episode. There was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earlier. The patient was admitted with a pulmonary-renal syndrome with hemoptysis, rapidly progressive renal failure, and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit. After receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation, the patient recovered cardiac rhythm. The ECG showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhythmia. This study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP). These mechanisms are not well understood because, in most cases, the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event. Rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here, and the authors discount ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism.",1,1,1,0

"Rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage. Warfarin-associated intracerebral hemorrhage (W-ICH) is a severe type of stroke. There is no consensus on the optimal treatment for W-ICH. Using a mouse model, we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volume. Male CD-1 mice were treated with warfarin (2 mg/kg over 24 h), resulting in a mean (+/-s.d.) International Normalized Ratio of 3.5+/-0.9. First, we showed that an intravenous administration of human PCC rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mice. Second, a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right striatum. Forty-five minutes later, the animals were randomly treated with PCC (100 U/kg) or saline i.v. (n=12 per group). Twenty-four hours after hemorrhage induction, hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin assay. The mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in PCC-treated animals (6.5+/-3.1 microL) compared with saline controls (15.3+/-11.2 microL, P=0.015). In the saline group, 45% of the mice developed large hematomas (i.e., >15 microL). In contrast, such extensive lesions were never found in the PCC group. We provide experimental data suggesting PCC to be an effective acute treatment for W-ICH in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volume. Future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human W-ICH.",0,0,1,0
"Biochemical and structural analysis of missense mutations in N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase causing mucopolysaccharidosis IVA phenotypes. Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA ( MPS IVA ; OMIM # 253000 ) , a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase ( GALNS ) , has variable clinical phenotypes . To date we have identified 65 missense mutations in the GALNS gene from MPS IVA patients , but the correlation between genotype and phenotype has remained unclear . We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches and 32 missense mutations , using structural analyses . Fifteen missense mutations and two newly engineered active site mutations ( C79S , C79T ) were characterized by transient expression analysis . Mutant proteins , except for C79S and C79T , were destabilized and detected as insoluble precursor forms while the C79S and C79T mutants were of a soluble mature size . Mutants found in the severe phenotype had no activity . Mutants found in the mild phenotype had a considerable residual activity ( 1 . 3-13 . 3 % of wild-type GALNS activity ) . Sulfatases , including GALNS , are members of a highly conserved gene family sharing an extensive sequence homology . Thus , a tertiary structural model of human GALNS was constructed from the X-ray crystal structure of N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase and arylsulfatase A , using homology modeling , and 32 missense mutations were investigated . Consequently , we propose that there are at least three different reasons for the severe phenotype  ( i ) destruction of the hydrophobic core or modification of the packing ; ( ii ) removal of a salt bridge to destabilize the entire conformation ; ( iii ) modification of the active site . In contrast , mild mutations were mostly located on the surface of the GALNS protein . These studies shed further light on the genotype-phenotype correlation of MPS IVA and structure-function relationship in the sulfatase family .",0,0,1,0

"Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin-induced renal damage. BACKGROUND: In man, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels, related to ACE (I/D) genotype, are associated with renal prognosis. This raises the hypothesis that individual differences in renal ACE activity are involved in renal susceptibility to inflicted damage. Therefore, we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats. METHODS: Renal ACE activity (Hip-His-Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats. After 1 week of recovery, proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [1.5 mg/kg intravenously (i.v.) n = 18; controls, saline i.v. n = 9]. Proteinuria was measured every 2 weeks. After 12 weeks, rats were sacrificed and their kidneys harvested. RESULTS: As anticipated, adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria, renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis. Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin (r = 0.62, P<0.01), renal interstitial alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.49, P<0.05), interstitial macrophage influx (r = 0.56, P<0.05), interstitial collagen III (r = 0.53, P<0.05), glomerular alpha-smooth muscle actin (r = 0.74, P<0.01) and glomerular desmin (r = 0.48, P<0.05). Baseline renal ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis (r = 0.22, NS). In controls, no predictive values for renal parameters were observed. CONCLUSION: Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin-induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain. This supports the assumption that differences in renal ACE activity predispose to a less favourable course of renal damage.",0,1,0,0
"Identification of a single nucleotide change in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRTYale) responsible for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Complete deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) causes the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome . Previous characterization of a mutant form of HPRT , HPRTYale , from a subject with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome revealed normal mRNA and protein concentrations , no residual catalytic activity , and cathodal migration upon PAGE . We have cloned and sequenced HPRTYale cDNA . The nucleotide sequence of full-length HPRTYale cDNA revealed a single nucleotide substitution compared with normal HPRT cDNA  G----C at nucleotide position 211 . This transversion predicts substitution of arginine for glycine at amino acid position 71 , explaining the cathodal migration of HPRTYale . Chou-Fasman secondary structure analysis predicts a change in the probability of beta-turn formation in the region containing the mutation .

"Phase II study of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. BACKGROUND: The activity of the combination of carboplatin and liposomal doxorubicin was tested in a Phase II study of patients with recurrent cervical carcinoma. METHODS: The combination of carboplatin (area under the concentration curve [AUC], 5) and liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil; starting dose, 40 mg/m(2)) was administered intravenously every 28 days to 37 patients with recurrent squamous cell cervical carcinoma to determine antitumor activity and toxicity profile. RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were assessable for response, and 35 patients were assessable for toxicity. The overall response rate was 38%, the median time to response was 10 weeks, the median duration of response was 26 weeks, and the median survival was 37 weeks. The main toxic effect was myelosuppression, with Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia in 16 patients, anemia in 12 patients, thrombocytopenia in 11 patients, and neutropenic fever in 3 patients. Four patients had five infusion-related reactions during the infusion of liposomal doxorubicin, leading to treatment discontinuation in three patients.

"The selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist Ro4368554 restores memory performance in cholinergic and serotonergic models of memory deficiency in the rat. Antagonists at serotonin type 6 (5-HT(6)) receptors show activity in models of learning and memory. Although the underlying mechanism(s) are not well understood, these effects may involve an increase in acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The present study sought to characterize the cognitive-enhancing effects of the 5-HT(6) antagonist Ro4368554 (3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)1H-indole) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic (scopolamine pretreatment) and a serotonergic- (tryptophan (TRP) depletion) deficient model, and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate. Initial testing in a time-dependent forgetting task employing a 24-h delay between training and testing showed that metrifonate improved object recognition (at 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o.), whereas Ro4368554 was inactive. Both, Ro4368554 (3 and 10 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i.p.)) and metrifonate (10 mg/kg, p.o., respectively) reversed memory deficits induced by scopolamine and TRP depletion (10 mg/kg, i.p., and 3 mg/kg, p.o., respectively). In conclusion, although Ro4368554 did not improve a time-related retention deficit, it reversed a cholinergic and a serotonergic memory deficit, suggesting that both mechanisms may be involved in the facilitation of object memory by Ro4368554 and, possibly, other 5-HT(6) receptor antagonists.",0,0,1,0
"Disulfiram-induced transient optic and peripheral neuropathy: a case report.

"Spironolactone: is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin B-related hypokalemia in cancer patients?. OBJECTIVE: Nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin B (AmB), often limiting administration of full dosage. Selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with AmB. Potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of AmB. This study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment. METHODS: In this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous AmB alone or AmB and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infection. RESULTS: Patients receiving concomitant AmB and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.0027). Those patients receiving AmB and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range (P = 0.022). Moreover, urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving AmB and spironolactone than those receiving AmB alone (P = 0.040). CONCLUSION: This study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on AmB treatment.",0,1,1,1
"99mTc-glucarate for detection of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Infarct-avid radiopharmaceuticals are necessary for rapid and timely diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. The animal model used to produce infarction implies artery ligation but chemical induction can be easily obtained with isoproterenol. A new infarct-avid radiopharmaceutical based on glucaric acid was prepared in the hospital radiopharmacy of the INCMNSZ. 99mTc-glucarate was easy to prepare, stable for 96 h and was used to study its biodistribution in rats with isoproterenol-induced acute myocardial infarction. Histological studies demonstrated that the rats developed an infarct 18 h after isoproterenol administration. The rat biodistribution studies showed a rapid blood clearance via the kidneys. Thirty minutes after 99mTc-glucarate administration the standardised heart uptake value S(h)UV was 4.7 in infarcted rat heart which is six times more than in normal rats. ROIs drawn over the gamma camera images showed a ratio of 4.4.

"Susceptibility to seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats after microinjection of isoniazid or gamma-vinyl-GABA into the substantia nigra. Pilocarpine, given intraperitoneally to rats, reproduces the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buildup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the forebrain. In the present study, the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats, were investigated. In animals pretreated with microinjections of isoniazid, 150 micrograms, an inhibitor of activity of the GABA-synthesizing enzyme, L-glutamic acid decarboxylase, into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR), bilaterally, non-convulsant doses of pilocarpine, 100 and 200 mg/kg, resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilepticus. Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine-induced convulsions. Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure-related damage to the hippocampal formation, thalamus, amygdala, olfactory cortex, substantia nigra and neocortex, which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg/kg. Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg. Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase, gamma-vinyl-GABA (D,L-4-amino-hex-5-enoic acid), 5 micrograms, into the SNR, bilaterally, suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. This treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain damage. Microinjections of gamma-vinyl-GABA, 5 micrograms, into the dorsal striatum, bilaterally, failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. The results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra.",0,1,1,0
"Clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for at least one year. BACKGROUND: We clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus (FK506) for more than 1 year. METHODS: Twenty-six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evaluated. Thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent (nonepisode biopsy) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy (episode biopsy). RESULTS: The main pathologic diagnoses (some overlap) were acute rejection (AR; n = 4), chronic rejection (CR; n=5), AR+CR (n =4), recurrent IgA nephropathy (n =5), normal findings (n =2), minimal-type chronic FK506 nephropathy (n = 9), and mild-type FK506 nephropathy (n = 11). Of the nonepisode biopsies, 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal-type and mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy, respectively. Chronic FK506 nephropathy consisted of rough and foamy tubular vacuolization (5 biopsies), arteriolopathy (angiodegeneration of the arteriolar wall; 20 biopsies), focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (4 biopsies) and the striped form of interstitial fibrosis (11 biopsies). The serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy group, which included 7 episode biopsies, were statistically higher than those in the minimum-type chronic FK506-nephropathy group (P< 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that chronic FK506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteriolopathy manifesting as insudative hyalinosis of the arteriolar wall, and suggests that mild-type chronic FK506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function.",0,1,0,0

Direct DNA sequencing was done to screen the entire coding region of the WFS1 gene in 30 patients from 19 British kindreds with Wolfram syndrome . DNA was also screened for structural rearrangements ( deletions and duplications ) and point mutations in mtDNA . No pathogenic mtDNA mutations were found in our cohort . We identified 24 mutations in the WFS1 gene  8 nonsense mutations , 8 missense mutations , 3 in-frame deletions , 1 in-frame insertion , and 4 frameshift mutations . Of these , 23 were novel mutations , and most occurred in exon 8 . The majority of patients were compound heterozygotes for two mutations , and there was no common founder mutation . The data were also analyzed for genotype-phenotype relationships . Although some interesting cases were noted , consideration of the small sample size and frequency of each mutation indicated no clear-cut correlations between any of the observed mutations and disease severity . There were no obvious mutation hot spots or clusters . Hence , molecular screening for Wolfram syndrome in affected families and for Wolfram syndrome-carrier status in subjects with psychiatric disorders or diabetes mellitus will require complete analysis of exon 8 and upstream exons . .",0,0,1,0
"Fluoxetine-induced akathisia: clinical and theoretical implications. Five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed akathisia. The typical fluoxetine-induced symptoms of restlessness, constant pacing, purposeless movements of the feet and legs, and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic-induced akathisia. Three patients who had experienced neuroleptic-induced akathisia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine-induced akathisia were identical, although somewhat milder. Akathisia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, dose reduction, or both. The authors suggest that fluoxetine-induced akathisia may be caused by serotonergically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine-induced akathisia and tricyclic antidepressant-induced ""jitteriness"" may be identical.",0,0,1,0

"Risk factors and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysians with Parkinson's disease. Chronic pulsatile levodopa therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD) leads to the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. We studied the prevalence and predictors of levodopa-induced dyskinesia among multiethnic Malaysian patients with PD. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study involving 95 patients with PD on uninterrupted levodopa therapy for at least 6 months. The instrument used was the UPDRS questionnaires. The predictors of dyskinesia were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: The mean age was 65.6 + 8.5 years. The mean onset age was 58.5 + 9.8 years. The median disease duration was 6 (7) years. Dyskinesia was present in 44% (n = 42) with median levodopa therapy of 3 years. There were 64.3% Chinese, 31% Malays, and 3.7% Indians and other ethnic groups. Eighty-one percent of patients with dyskinesia had clinical fluctuations. Patients with dyskinesia had lower onset age ( p < 0.001), longer duration of levodopa therapy ( p < 0.001), longer disease duration ( p < 0.001), higher total daily levodopa dose ( p < 0.001), and higher total UPDRS scores ( p = 0.005) than patients without dyskinesia. The three significant predictors of dyskinesia were duration of levodopa therapy, onset age, and total daily levodopa dose. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in our patients was 44%. The most significant predictors were duration of levodopa therapy, total daily levodopa dose, and onset age.",0,0,1,0

"The cytogenetic action of ifosfamide, mesna, and their combination on peripheral rabbit lymphocytes: an in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic study. Ifosfamide (IFO) is an alkylating nitrogen mustard, administrated as an antineoplasmic agent. It is characterized by its intense urotoxic action, leading to hemorrhagic cystitis. This side effect of IFO raises the requirement for the co-administration with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) aiming to avoid or minimize this effect. IFO and Mesna were administrated separately on rabbit's lymphocytes in vivo, which were later developed in vitro. Cytogenetic markers for sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI) and Mitotic Index were recorded. Mesna's action, in conjunction with IFO reduces the frequency of SCEs, in comparison with the SCEs recordings obtained when IFO is administered alone. In addition to this, when high concentrations of Mesna were administered alone significant reductions of the PRI were noted, than with IFO acting at the same concentration on the lymphocytes. Mesna significantly reduces IFO's genotoxicity, while when administered in high concentrations it acts in an inhibitory fashion on the cytostatic action of the drug.",0,0,0,1

"Anticonvulsant effect of eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093) on seizures induced by microperfusion of picrotoxin in the hippocampus of freely moving rats. Eslicarbazepine acetate (BIA 2-093, S-(-)-10-acetoxy-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo/b,f/azepine-5-carboxamide) is a novel antiepileptic drug, now in Phase III clinical trials, designed with the aim of improving efficacy and safety in comparison with the structurally related drugs carbamazepine (CBZ) and oxcarbazepine (OXC). We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole-animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns. In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin, the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2, and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s. Pre-treatment with a dose of 30 mg/kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats. Lower doses (3 and 10mg/kg) did not suppress seizures, however, after administration of 10mg/kg, significant reductions in seizures duration (24.3+/-6.8s) and seizure number (1.6+/-0.34) were found. No adverse effects of eslicarbazepine acetate were observed in the behavioral/EEG patterns studied, including sleep/wakefulness cycle, at the doses studied.",0,0,1,0

"An evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology/oncology population. Amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram-negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infections. Strategies of extended-interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population; however, data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology/oncology population. To evaluate amikacin-associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology/oncology population, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted at a university-affiliated medical center. Forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic/oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended-interval amikacin. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were assessed. The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended-interval groups, at 10% and 5%, respectively (P = 1.00). Six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture, compared with none in the extended-interval group (P = 0.002). The occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens, but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two groups. Efficacy could not be assessed.",0,1,0,0

"Acute cocaine-induced seizures: differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse strains. Mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of cocaine. Cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses (50-100 mg/kg) and behavior was monitored for 20 minutes. Seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clonus, latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping bouncing seizure. A range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with A/J and SJL mice being most sensitive and C57BL/6J most resistant. DBA/2J, BALB/cByJ and NZW/LacJ strains exhibited intermediate sensitivity. EEG recordings were made in SJL, A/J and C57BL/6J mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavior. Additionally, levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant strains.

"Learning and memory deficits in ecstasy users and their neural correlates during a face-learning task. It has been consistently shown that ecstasy users display impairments in learning and memory performance. In addition, working memory processing in ecstasy users has been shown to be associated with neural alterations in hippocampal and/or cortical regions as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls. To address the potential confounding effects of the cannabis use of the ecstasy using group, a second analysis included 14 previously tested cannabis users (Nestor, L., Roberts, G., Garavan, H., Hester, R., 2008. Deficits in learning and memory: parahippocampal hyperactivity and frontocortical hypoactivity in cannabis users. Neuroimage 40, 1328-1339). Ecstasy users performed significantly worse in learning and memory compared to controls and cannabis users. A conjunction analysis of the encode and recall phases of the task revealed ecstasy-specific hyperactivity in bilateral frontal regions, left temporal, right parietal, bilateral temporal, and bilateral occipital brain regions. Ecstasy-specific hypoactivity was evident in the right dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (ACC) and left posterior cingulated cortex. In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate. These results elucidated ecstasy-related deficits, only some of which might be attributed to cannabis use. These ecstasy-specific effects may be related to the vulnerability of isocortical and allocortical regions to the neurotoxic effects of ecstasy.",0,0,1,0
"Cerebral blood flow and metabolism during isoflurane-induced hypotension in patients subjected to surgery for cerebral aneurysms. Cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane-induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurysm. Flow and metabolism were measured 5-13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical Kety-Schmidt technique using xenon-133 i.v. Anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.75% (plus 67% nitrous oxide in oxygen), during which CBF and CMRO2 were 34.3 +/- 2.1 ml/100 g min-1 and 2.32 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1 at PaCO2 4.1 +/- 0.1 kPa (mean +/- SEM). Controlled hypotension to an average MAP of 50-55 mm Hg was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane, and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 +/- 0.2%. This resulted in a significant decrease in CMRO2 (to 1.73 +/- 0.16 ml/100 g min-1), while CBF was unchanged. After the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75%. There was a significant increase in CBF, although CMRO2 was unchanged, compared with pre-hypotensive values.

"Chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lidocaine. The effects of carbamazepine (CBZ) treatment on local anesthetic-kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of CBZ administration. Chronic oral CBZ inhibited the development of both lidocaine- and cocaine-induced seizures, but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seizures. Chronic CBZ also decreased the incidence of seizure-related mortality in the cocaine-injected rats. Acute CBZ over a range of doses (15-50 mg/kg) had no effect on completed lidocaine-kindled or acute cocaine-induced seizures. Repeated i.p. injection of CBZ (15 mg/kg) also was without effect on the development of lidocaine- or cocaine-kindled seizures. The differential effects of CBZ depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic-kindled seizures. The effectiveness of chronic but not repeated, intermittent injections of CBZ suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment regimens. The possible utility of chronic CBZ in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data, but remains to be directly evaluated.",0,0,1,0

"Some Mexican glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficiency appears to be fairly common in Mexico . We have now examined the DNA of three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants , -G6PD Distrito Federal , G6PD Tepic , and G6PD Castilla . All three of these variants , believed on the basis of biochemical characterization and population origin to be unique , have the G----A transition at nucleotide 202 and the A----G transition at nucleotide 376 , mutations that we now recognize to be characteristic of G6PD A- . Two other Mexican males with G6PD deficiency were found to have the same mutation . All five have the ( NlaIII / FokI / PvuII / PstI ) haplotype characteristic of G6PD A -in Africa . Since the PvuII + genotype seems to be rare in Europe , we conclude that all of these G6PD A - genes had their ancient origin in Africa , although in many of the Mexican patients with G6PD A -202A / 376G the gene may have been imported more recently from Spain , where this variant , formerly known as G6PD Betica , is also prevalent . .",0,0,1,0

"Efficacy of olanzapine in acute bipolar mania: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The Olanzipine HGGW Study Group. BACKGROUND: We compared the efficacy and safety of olanzapine vs placebo for the treatment of acute bipolar mania. METHODS: Four-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel study. A total of 115 patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar disorder, manic or mixed, were randomized to olanzapine, 5 to 20 mg/d (n = 55), or placebo (n = 60). The primary efficacy measure was the Young-Mania Rating Scale (Y-MRS) total score. Response and euthymia were defined, a priori, as at least a 50% improvement from baseline to end point and as a score of no less than 12 at end point in the Y-MRS total score, respectively. Safety was assessed using adverse events, Extrapyramidal Symptom (EPS) rating scales, laboratory values, electrocardiograms, vital signs, and weight change. RESULTS: Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) improvement in Y-MRS total score than placebo-treated patients (-14.8 +/- 12.5 and -8.1 +/- 12.7, respectively; P<.001), which was evident at the first postbaseline observation 1 week after randomization and was maintained throughout the study (last observation carried forward). Olanzapine-treated patients demonstrated a higher rate of response (65% vs 43%, respectively; P =.02) and euthymia (61% vs 36%, respectively; P =. 01) than placebo-treated patients. There were no statistically significant differences in EPSs between groups. However, olanzapine-treated patients had a statistically significant greater mean (+/- SD) weight gain than placebo-treated patients (2.1 +/- 2.8 vs 0.45 +/- 2.3 kg, respectively) and also experienced more treatment-emergent somnolence (21 patients [38.2%] vs 5 [8.3% ], respectively).

"Central action of narcotic analgesics. Part IV. Noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rats. The effect of clonidine, naphazoline and xylometazoline on analgesia induced by morphine, codeine, fentanyl and pentazocine, and on cataleptic effect of morphine, codine and fentanyl was studied in rats. The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline (NA) were also performed. It was found that three drugs stimulating central NA receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl. Codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline. The brain concentration of NA was not changed by morphine and fentanyl, but one of the doses of codeine (45 mg/kg) slightly enhanced it. Pentazocine dose-dependently decreased the brain level of NA. The rate of NA turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl (0.2 mg/kg) following which the disappearance of NA from the brain was diminished. The results are discussed in the light of various and non-uniform data from the literature. It is suggested that in rats the brain NA plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics.",0,1,1,0

"Severe complications of antianginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabolizer of metoprolol, propafenone, diltiazem, and sparteine. A 47-year-old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the CCU in shock with III. AV block, severe hypotension, and impairment of ventricular function. One week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol (100 mg t.i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d.) had been initiated. Two days before admission diltiazem (60 mg b.i.d.) was prescribed in addition. Analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol (greater than 3000 ng/ml) and diltiazem (526 ng/ml). The patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of antianginal therapy. Three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol, diltiazem, propafenone (since he had received this drug in the past), and sparteine (as a probe for the debrisoquine/sparteine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism). It was found that he was a poor metabolizer of all four drugs, indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic control. Therefore, patients belonging to the poor-metabolizer phenotype of sparteine/debrisoquine polymorphism in drug metabolism, which constitutes 6.4% of the German population, may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs alone. Moreover, the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients.",1,0,0,0
"A transgene insertion creating a heritable chromosome deletion mouse model of Prader-Willi and angelman syndromes. Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) and Angelman syndrome ( AS ) result from the loss of function of imprinted genes in human chromosome 15q11-q13 . The central part of mouse chromosome 7 is homologous to human 15q11-q13 , with conservation of both gene order and imprinted features . We report here the characterization of a transgene insertion ( Epstein-Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A , LMP2A ) into mouse chromosome 7C , which has resulted in mouse models for PWS and AS dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent . Epigenotype ( allelic expression and DNA methylation ) and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses indicate that the transgene-induced mutation has generated a complete deletion of the PWS / AS-homologous region but has not deleted flanking loci . Because the intact chromosome 7 , opposite the deleted homolog , maintains the correct imprint in somatic cells of PWS and AS mice and establishes the correct imprint in male and female germ cells of AS mice , homologous association and replication asynchrony are not part of the imprinting mechanism . This heritable-deletion mouse model will be particularly useful for the identification of the etiological genes and mechanisms , phenotypic basis , and investigation of therapeutic approaches for PWS . .",0,0,1,0

"Hormones and risk of breast cancer. This paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therapy. The majority (29) had surgical menopause; their mean age was 45.7 years. It was hypothesized that progestins could equilibrate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therapy. The treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) 1.25 mg/day for 21 days and Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 10 days in each month. The mean treatment period was 18 months. During the follow-up period, attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology, physical examination, and plate thermography. Mastodynia was reported by 21 patients, and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Themography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mastodynia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mastodynia. Normalization was obtained by halving the estrogen dose. These results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied: 1) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic perspective; 2) cyclic treatment schedule, with a progestative phase of 10 days; and 3) periodic complete follow-up, with accurate thermographic evaluation of the breast target tissues.",0,0,0,1
"Calcineurin-inhibitor induced pain syndrome (CIPS): a severe disabling complication after organ transplantation. Bone pain after transplantation is a frequent complication that can be caused by several diseases. Treatment strategies depend on the correct diagnosis of the pain. Nine patients with severe pain in their feet, which was registered after transplantation, were investigated. Bone scans showed an increased tracer uptake of the foot bones. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated bone marrow oedema in the painful bones. Pain was not explained by other diseases causing foot pain, like reflex sympathetic dystrophy, polyneuropathy, Morton's neuralgia, gout, osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, intermittent claudication, orthopaedic foot deformities, stress fractures, and hyperparathyroidism. The reduction of cyclosporine- or tacrolimus trough levels and the administration of calcium channel blockers led to relief of pain. The Calcineurin-inhibitor Induced Pain Syndrome (CIPS) is a rare but severe side effect of cyclosporine or tacrolimus and is accurately diagnosed by its typical presentation, magnetic resonance imaging and bone scans. Incorrect diagnosis of the syndrome will lead to a significant reduction of life quality in patients suffering from CIPS.",0,0,1,0

"Myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardiography. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischemia. Until now, the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery, and positive DSE has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. The aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by dobutamine. We performed DSE on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery stenosis. All patients had anginal attacks at rest with ST elevation on the electrocardiogram (variant angina). Coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine, and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patients. DSE was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 microg/kg/min every 5 minutes. Of the 51 patients, 7 patients showed asynergy with ST elevation. All 7 patients (13.7%) had chest pain during asynergy, and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by asynergy. These findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic angina. When DSE is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease, not only fixed coronary stenosis, but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of asynergy.",1,0,1,0
"Paclitaxel combined with carboplatin in the first-line treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In a phase I study to determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) given as a 3-hour infusion in combination with carboplatin administered every 21 days to women with advanced ovarian cancer, paclitaxel doses were escalated as follows: level 1, 135 mg/m2; level 2, 160 mg/m2; level 3, 185 mg/m2; and level 4,210 mg/m2. The fixed dose of carboplatin at levels 1 through 4 was given to achieve an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of 5 using the Calvert formula. In levels 5 and 6 the carboplatin dose was targeted at AUCs of 6 and 7.5, respectively, combined with a fixed paclitaxel dose of 185 mg/m2. To date, 30 previously untreated patients, all with a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0 to 2) have been entered into this ongoing study. The dose-limiting toxicity of the combination was myelosuppression (leukopenia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Neurotoxicity was largely moderate. So far, 14 patients are evaluable for response; of these, eight (57%) showed objective (complete or partial) response and disease stabilized in six patients. No patient had disease progression. We conclude that the combination of paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 administered as a 3-hour infusion followed immediately by a 1-hour infusion of carboplatin at an AUC of 6 can be administered safely in a 21-day schedule in the outpatient setting. The recommended dose for phase III studies is paclitaxel 185 mg/m2 and carboplatin AUC 6.",0,0,1,1

"Combined antiretroviral therapy causes cardiomyopathy and elevates plasma lactate in transgenic AIDS mice. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is implicated in cardiomyopathy (CM) and in elevated plasma lactate (LA) in AIDS through mechanisms of mitochondrial dysfunction. To determine mitochondrial events from HAART in vivo, 8-week-old hemizygous transgenic AIDS mice (NL4-3Delta gag/pol; TG) and wild-type FVB/n littermates were treated with the HAART combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and indinavir or vehicle control for 10 days or 35 days. At termination of the experiments, mice underwent echocardiography, quantitation of abundance of molecular markers of CM (ventricular mRNA encoding atrial natriuretic factor [ANF] and sarcoplasmic calcium ATPase [SERCA2]), and determination of plasma LA. Myocardial histologic features were analyzed semiquantitatively and results were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. After 35 days in the TG + HAART cohort, left ventricular mass increased 160% by echocardiography. Molecularly, ANF mRNA increased 250% and SERCA2 mRNA decreased 57%. Biochemically, LA was elevated (8.5 +/- 2.0 mM). Pathologically, granular cytoplasmic changes were found in cardiac myocytes, indicating enlarged, damaged mitochondria. Findings were confirmed ultrastructurally. No changes were found in other cohorts. After 10 days, only ANF was elevated, and only in the TG + HAART cohort. Results show that cumulative HAART caused mitochondrial CM with elevated LA in AIDS transgenic mice.",1,0,1,0
"Clinical nephrotoxicity of tobramycin and gentamicin. A prospective study. Nearly 3.2 million people in this country receive aminoglycoside antibiotics annually.

In this study, 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg/kg/day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside-related renal failure, defined as at least a one-third reduction in renal function. In these 62 patients, no other causes for renal failure could be identified. Five of 33 (15%) of the tobramycin-treated patients and 16 of 29 (55.2%) of the gentamicin-treated patients had renal failure.

"Attenuation of methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pretreatment. Immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic terminal damage. In this study, we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide, a pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factor, treatment in modulating the methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity. Lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine-elicited hyperthermia three days later. Such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in a dose-dependent manner. As the most potent dose (1 mg/kg) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks, one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen, methamphetamine-induced striatal dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions remained unaltered. Moreover, systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment (1 mg/kg) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion-produced dopamine and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid depletions in the striatum, indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of methamphetamine. We concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine-induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity.",0,0,1,0

"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with risperidone. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine D2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal ganglia. Risperidone, a benzisoxazole derivative antipsychotic, has high serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade and dose-related D2 receptor blockade. The high ratio is believed to impart the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dosages. With this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms, it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be lowered. A 73-year-old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with risperidone. The syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dantrolene and bromocriptine. It appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome.",0,0,1,0
"Amiodarone-related pulmonary mass and unique membranous glomerulonephritis in a patient with valvular heart disease: Diagnostic pitfall and new findings. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug for life-threatening tachycardia, but various adverse effects have been reported. Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease, in a patient who developed a lung mass (1.5 cm in diameter) and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time. The lung mass was highly suspected to be lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography, but histologically the lesion was composed of lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, indicating that it was an amiodarone-related lesion. In addition, the lung tissue had unevenly distributed hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were seen in the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic lung portions outside the mass. In the kidneys, glomeruli had membrane spikes, prominent swelling of podocytes and subepithelial deposits, which were sometimes large and hump-like. Autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms or other diseases with a known relationship to membranous glomerulonephritis were not found. The present case highlights the possibility that differential diagnosis between an amiodarone-related pulmonary lesion and a neoplasm can be very difficult radiologically, and suggests that membranous glomerulonephritis might be another possible complication of amiodarone treatment.",1,1,1,1

"Improvement by denopamine (TA-064) of pentobarbital-induced cardiac failure in the dog heart-lung preparation. The efficacy of denopamine, an orally active beta 1-adrenoceptor agonist, in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart-lung preparations. Cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital (118 +/- 28 mg; mean value +/- SD) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure (LV dP/dt max) had been reduced by about 35% and 26% of the respective controls were improved by denopamine (10-300 micrograms) in a dose-dependent manner. With 100 micrograms denopamine, almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained, associated with a slight increase in heart rate. No arrhythmias were induced by these doses of denopamine. The results warrant clinical trials of denopamine in the treatment of cardiac failure.",1,0,1,0

Dextromethorphan (DM), the dextrorotatory isomer of 3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, is the main ingredient in a number of widely available, over-the-counter antitussives. Initial studies (Bornstein 1968) showed that it possessed no respiratory suppressant effects and no addiction liability. Subsequently, however, several articles reporting abuse of this drug have appeared in the literature.

"The spectrum of RB1 germ-line mutations in hereditary retinoblastoma. We have searched for germ-line RB1 mutations in 119 patients with hereditary retinoblastoma . Previous investigations by Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis had revealed mutations in 48 patients . Here we report on the analysis of the remaining 71 patients . By applying heteroduplex analysis , nonisotopic SSCP , and direct sequencing , we detected germ-line mutations resulting in premature termination codons or disruption of splice signals in 51 ( 72 % ) of the 71 patients . Four patients also showed rare sequence variants . No region of the RB1 gene was preferentially involved in single base substitutions . Recurrent transitions were observed at most of the 14 codons within the RB1 . No mutation was observed in exons 25-27 , although this region contains two CGA codons . This suggests that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the RB1 gene may not be oncogenic . When these data were combined with the results of our previous investigations , mutations were identified in a total of 99 ( 83 % ) of 119 patients . The spectrum comprises 15 % large deletions , 26 % small length alterations , and 42 % base substitutions . No correlation between the location of frameshift or nonsense mutations and phenotypic features , including age at diagnosis , the number of tumor foci , and manifestation of nonocular tumors was observed . .",0,0,0,1
"Splicing defects in the ataxia-telangiectasia gene, ATM: underlying mutations and consequences. Mutations resulting in defective splicing constitute a significant proportion ( 30 / 62 [ 48 % ] ) of a new series of mutations in the ATM gene in patients with ataxia-telangiectasia ( AT ) that were detected by the protein-truncation assay followed by sequence analysis of genomic DNA . Fewer than half of the splicing mutations involved the canonical AG splice-acceptor site or GT splice-donor site . A higher percentage of mutations occurred at less stringently conserved sites , including silent mutations of the last nucleotide of exons , mutations in nucleotides other than the conserved AG and GT in the consensus splice sites , and creation of splice-acceptor or splice-donor sites in either introns or exons . These splicing mutations led to a variety of consequences , including exon skipping and , to a lesser degree , intron retention , activation of cryptic splice sites , or creation of new splice sites . In addition , 5 of 12 nonsense mutations and 1 missense mutation were associated with deletion in the cDNA of the exons in which the mutations occurred . No ATM protein was detected by western blotting in any AT cell line in which splicing mutations were identified . Several cases of exon skipping in both normal controls and patients for whom no underlying defect could be found in genomic DNA were also observed , suggesting caution in the interpretation of exon deletions observed in ATM cDNA when there is no accompanying identification of genomic mutations . .",0,0,1,0

"GEM-P chemotherapy is active in the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a relatively chemosensitive malignancy. However, for those who relapse, high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell transplant is the treatment of choice which relies on adequate disease control with salvage chemotherapy. Regimens commonly used often require inpatient administration and can be difficult to deliver due to toxicity. Gemcitabine and cisplatin have activity in HL, non-overlapping toxicity with first-line chemotherapeutics, and may be delivered in an outpatient setting. In this retrospective single-centre analysis, patients with relapsed or refractory HL treated with gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m(2) day (D)1, D8 and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2) D15, every 28 days (GEM-P) were included. Demographic, survival, response and toxicity data were recorded. Forty-one eligible patients were identified: median age 27. One hundred and twenty-two cycles of GEM-P were administered in total (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty of 41 (48 %) patients received GEM-P as second-line treatment and 11/41 (27 %) as third-line therapy. Overall response rate (ORR) to GEM-P in the entire cohort was 80 % (complete response (CR) 37 %, partial response 44 %) with 14/15 CR confirmed as a metabolic CR on PET and ORR of 85 % in the 20 second-line patients. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological: neutropenia 54 % and thrombocytopenia 51 %. Median follow-up from the start of GEM-P was 4.5 years. Following GEM-P, 5-year progression-free survival was 46 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 30-62 %) and 5-year overall survival was 59 % (95 % CI, 43-74 %). Fourteen of 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant.

"Therapeutic drug monitoring of tobramycin: once-daily versus twice-daily dosage schedules. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of dosage regimen (once-daily vs. twice-daily) of tobramicyn on steady-state serum concentrations and toxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients undergoing treatment with i.v. tobramycin (4 mg/kg/day) were randomised to two groups. Group OD (n = 22) received a once-daily dose of tobramycin and group TD (n = 21) received the same dose divided into two doses daily. Tobramycin serum concentrations (peak and trough) were measured by enzyme multiplied immunoassay. The renal and auditory functions of the patients were monitored before, during and immediately after treatment. RESULTS: The two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, body weight and renal function. No statistically significant differences were found in mean daily dose, duration of treatment, or cumulative dose. Trough concentrations were < 2 g/ml in the two groups (100%). Peak concentrations were > 6 microg/ml in 100% of the OD group and in 67% of the TD group (P< 0.01). Mean peak concentrations were markedly different: 11.00+/-2.89 microg/ml in OD vs. 6.53+/-1.45 microg/ml in TD (P< 0.01). The pharmacokinetics parameters were: Ke, (0.15+/-0.03/h in OD vs. 0.24+/-0.06/h in TD), t1/2, (4.95+/-1.41 h in OD vs. 3.07+/-0.71 h in TD), Vd (0.35+/-0.11 l/kg in OD vs. 0.33+/-0.09 l/kg in TD), Cl (0.86+/-0.29 ml/min/kg in OD vs. 1.28+/-0.33 ml/min/kg in TD). Increased serum creatinine was observed in 73% of patients in OD versus 57% of patients in TD, without evidence of nephrotoxicity. In TD group, three patients developed decreased auditory function, of which one presented with an auditory loss of -30 dB, whereas in the OD group only one patient presented decreased auditory function. CONCLUSION: This small study suggests that a once-daily dosing regimen of tobramycin is at least as effective as and is no more and possibly less toxic than the twice-daily regimen. Using a single-dose therapy, peak concentration determination is not necessary, only trough samples should be monitored to ensure levels below 2 microg/ml.",0,1,0,0

At 7 years of age he was referred to us by the paediatrician because of symptoms of Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . He showed short stature , obesity , mild developmental delay , cryptorchidism , and some mild dysmorphic features . The history further indicated intrauterine growth retardation at the end of the pregnancy . His mother was 44 years of age at the time of his birth . After birth he showed hypotonia with poor sucking , for which gavage feeding was needed . Motor development was delayed . After 1 year he became obese despite a normal appetite . Recurrent middle ear infections , a high pain threshold , and a great skill with jigsaw puzzles were reported . There were no behavioural problems or sleep disturbance . Chromosomal analysis was normal ( 46 , XY ) . DNA analysis for Prader-Willi syndrome showed no abnormalities . Two years later he was re-examined because we thought his features fitted the PWS-like phenotype associated with maternal UPD ( 14 ) . At that time precocious puberty was evident . DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy for chromosome 14 . In all the previously described 11 cases with maternal UPD ( 14 ) , a Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 was detected cytogenetically before DNA analysis . This is the first report of diagnosis of maternal UPD ( 14 ) based on clinical features .

"P53 inhibition exacerbates late-stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity. AIMS: Doxorubicin (DOX) is an effective anti-cancer therapeutic, but is associated with both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity. Children are particularly sensitive to DOX-induced heart failure. Here, the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late-stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice (which express dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes) and their non-transgenic (NON-TXG) littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks (25 mg/kg cumulative dose). One week after the last DOX treatment (acute stage), MHC-CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON-TXG mice. Surprisingly, by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment (late stage), MHC-CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON-TXG mice. p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation in MHC-CB7 mice, which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function, higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals. CONCLUSION: These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, mediated via STAT3 activation, mitigates DOX-induced myocardial stress during drug delivery. Furthermore, these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and, paradoxically, enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment.",1,1,1,1

"Differential diagnosis of high serum creatine kinase levels in systemic lupus erythematosus. We report the clinical and bioptic findings for a 57-year-old woman with severe chloroquine-induced myopathy. Since 1989, she had been suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with renal involvement and undergone periods of treatment with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide. Additional therapy with chloroquine (CQ) was started because of arthralgia. At the same time, slightly increased creatine kinase (CK) levels were noted. Myositis was suspected, and the patient was treated with steroids. The CK increase persisted, however, and she developed progressive muscular weakness and muscular atrophy. Routine controls revealed markedly elevated CK levels of 1,700 U/l. The neurological and electrophysiological findings were not typical of myositis. Thus, muscle biopsy of the deltoid muscle was performed in order to exclude polymyositis or toxic myopathy. As it revealed chloroquine-induced myopathy, medication was stopped. Discriminating between primary SLE-induced affection of the musculoskeletal system and drug-induced side effects is important for appropriate treatment of SLE patients.",0,1,1,0
"A pilot study to assess the safety of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the emergency department evaluation of cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chest pain in the setting of cocaine use poses a diagnostic dilemma. Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a widely available and sensitive test for evaluating cardiac ischemia. Because of the theoretical concern regarding administration of dobutamine in the setting of cocaine use, we conducted a pilot study to assess the safety of DSE in emergency department patients with cocaine-associated chest pain. METHODS: A prospective case series was conducted in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit in the ED of an urban tertiary-care teaching hospital. Patients were eligible for DSE if they had used cocaine within 24 hours preceding the onset of chest pain and had a normal ECG and tropinin I level. Patients exhibiting signs of continuing cocaine toxicity were excluded from the study. All patients were admitted to the hospital for serial testing after the DSE testing in the intensive diagnostic and treatment unit. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Two patients had inadequate resting images, one DSE was terminated because of inferior hypokinesis, another DSE was terminated because of a rate-related atrial conduction deficit, and 1 patient did not reach the target heart rate. Thus, 19 patients completed a DSE and reached their target heart rates. None of the patients experienced signs of exaggerated adrenergic response, which was defined as a systolic blood pressure of greater than 200 mm Hg or the occurrence of tachydysrhythmias (excluding sinus tachycardia). Further suggesting lack of exaggerated adrenergic response, 13 (65%) of 20 patients required supplemental atropine to reach their target heart rates. CONCLUSION: No exaggerated adrenergic response was detected when dobutamine was administered to patients with cocaine-related chest pain.",1,0,0,0

"Glyceryl trinitrate induces attacks of migraine without aura in sufferers of migraine with aura. Migraine with aura and migraine without aura have the same pain phase, thus indicating that migraine with aura and migraine without aura share a common pathway of nociception. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that the messenger molecule nitric oxide (NO) is involved in pain mechanisms of migraine without aura. In order to clarify whether the same is true for migraine with aura, in the present study we examined the headache response to intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) (0.5 microg/kg/min for 20 min) in 12 sufferers of migraine with aura. The specific aim was to elucidate whether an aura and/or an attack of migraine without aura could be induced. Fourteen healthy subjects served as controls. Aura symptoms were not elicited in any subject. Headache was more severe in migraineurs than in the controls during and immediately after GTN infusion (p=0.037) as well as during the following 11 h (p = 0.008). In the controls, the GTN-induced headache gradually disappeared, whereas in migraineurs peak headache intensity occurred at a mean time of 240 min post-infusion. At this time the induced headache in 6 of 12 migraineurs fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for migraine without aura of the International Headache Society. The results therefore suggest that NO is involved in the pain mechanisms of migraine with aura. Since cortical spreading depression has been shown to liberate NO in animals, this finding may help our understanding of the coupling between cortical spreading depression and headache in migraine with aura.",0,0,1,0

"Efficacy and proarrhythmia with the use of d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. This study prospectively evaluated the clinical efficacy, the incidence of torsades de pointes, and the presumable risk factors for torsades de pointes in patients treated with d,l-sotalol for sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Eighty-one consecutive patients (54 with coronary artery disease, and 20 with dilated cardiomyopathy) with inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation received oral d,l-sotalol to prevent induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia. During oral loading with d,l-sotalol, continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring was performed. Those patients in whom d,l-sotalol prevented induction of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation were discharged with the drug and followed up on an outpatient basis for 21 +/- 18 months. Induction of the ventricular tachyarrhythmia was prevented by oral d,l-sotalol in 35 (43%) patients; the ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible in 40 (49%) patients; and two (2.5%) patients did not tolerate even 40 mg of d,l-sotalol once daily. Four (5%) patients had from torsades de pointes during the initial oral treatment with d,l-sotalol. Neither ECG [sinus-cycle length (SCL), QT or QTc interval, or U wave] nor clinical parameters identified patients at risk for torsades de pointes. However, the oral dose of d,l-sotalol was significantly lower in patients with torsades de pointes (200 +/- 46 vs. 328 +/- 53 mg/day; p = 0.0017). Risk factors associated with the development of torsades de pointes were the appearance of an U wave (p = 0.049), female gender (p = 0.015), and significant dose-corrected changes of SCL, QT interval, and QTc interval (p < 0.05). During follow-up, seven (20%) patients had a nonfatal ventricular tachycardia recurrence, and two (6%) patients died suddenly. One female patient with stable cardiac disease had recurrent torsades de pointes after 2 years of successful treatment with d,l-sotalol. Torsades de pointes occurred early during treatment even with low doses of oral d,l-sotalol. Pronounced changes in the surface ECG (cycle length, QT, and QTc) in relation to the dose of oral d,l-sotalol might identify a subgroup of patients with an increased risk for torsades de pointes. Other ECG parameters before the application of d,l-sotalol did not identify patients at increased risk for torsades de pointes. Recurrence rates of ventricular tachyarrhythmias are high despite complete suppression of the arrhythmia during programmed stimulation. Therefore programmed electrical stimulation in the case of d,l-sotalol seems to be of limited prognostic value.",1,0,1,0
"Autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus with continued secretion of mutant weakly active vasopressin. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by post-natal development of arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) deficiency due to mutations in the AVP gene . All published mutations affect the signal peptide or the neurophysin-II carrier protein and are presumed to interfere with processing of the preprohormone , leading to neuronal damage . We studied an unusual Palestinian family consisting of asymptomatic first cousin parents and three children affected with neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus , suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance . All three affected children were homozygous and the parents heterozygous for a single novel mutation ( C301- > T ) in exon 1 , replacing Pro7 of mature AVP with Leu ( Leu-AVP ) . Leu-AVP was a weak agonist with approximately 30-fold reduced binding to the human V2 receptor . Measured by radioimmunoassay with a synthetic Leu-AVP standard , serum Leu-AVP levels were elevated in all three children and further increased during water deprivation to as high as 30 times normal . The youngest child ( 2 years old ) was only mildly affected but had Leu-AVP levels similar to her severely affected 8-year-old brother , suggesting that unknown mechanisms may partially compensate for a deficiency of active AVP in very young children . .",0,0,1,0

"Prevention of breast cancer with tamoxifen: preliminary findings from the Italian randomised trial among hysterectomised women. Italian Tamoxifen Prevention Study. BACKGROUND: Tamoxifen is a candidate chemopreventive agent in breast cancer, although the drug may be associated with the development of endometrial cancer. Therefore we did a trial in hysterectomised women of tamoxifen as a chemopreventive. METHODS: In October, 1992, we started a double-blind placebo-controlled, randomised trial of tamoxifen in women (mainly in Italy) who did not have breast cancer and who had had a hysterectomy. Women were randomised to receive tamoxifen 20 mg per day or placebo, both orally for 5 years. The original plan was to follow the intervention phase by 5 years' follow-up. In June, 1997, the trialists and the data-monitoring committee decided to end recruitment primarily because of the number of women dropping out of the study. Recruitment ended on July 11, 1997, and the study will continue as planned. The primary endpoints are the occurrence of and deaths from breast cancer. This preliminary interim analysis is based on intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: 5408 women were randomised; participating women have a median follow-up of 46 months for major endpoints. 41 cases of breast cancer occurred so far; there have been no deaths from breast cancer. There is no difference in breast-cancer frequency between the placebo (22 cases) and tamoxifen (19) arms. There is a statistically significant reduction of breast cancer among women receiving tamoxifen who also used hormone-replacement therapy during the trial: among 390 women on such therapy and allocated to placebo, we found eight cases of breast cancer compared with one case among 362 women allocated to tamoxifen. Compared with the placebo group, there was a significantly increased risk of vascular events and hypertriglyceridaemia among women on tamoxifen. INTERPRETATION: Although this preliminary analysis has low power, in this cohort of women at low-to-normal risk of breast cancer, the postulated protective effects of tamoxifen are not yet apparent. Women using hormone-replacement therapy appear to have benefited from use of tamoxifen. There were no deaths from breast cancer recorded in women in the study. It is essential to continue follow-up to quantify the long-term risks and benefits of tamoxifen therapy.",0,0,1,1

"Clonidine for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: II. ECG changes and adverse events analysis. OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety and tolerability of clonidine used alone or with methylphenidate in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHOD: In a 16-week multicenter, double-blind trial, 122 children with ADHD were randomly assigned to clonidine (n = 31), methylphenidate (n = 29), clonidine and methylphenidate (n = 32), or placebo (n = 30). Doses were flexibly titrated up to 0.6 mg/day for clonidine and 60 mg/day for methylphenidate (both with divided dosing). Groups were compared regarding adverse events and changes from baseline to week 16 in electrocardiograms and vital signs. RESULTS: There were more incidents of bradycardia in subjects treated with clonidine compared with those not treated with clonidine (17.5% versus 3.4%; p =.02), but no other significant group differences regarding electrocardiogram and other cardiovascular outcomes. There were no suggestions of interactions between clonidine and methylphenidate regarding cardiovascular outcomes. Moderate or severe adverse events were more common in subjects on clonidine (79.4% versus 49.2%; p =.0006) but not associated with higher rates of early study withdrawal. Drowsiness was common on clonidine, but generally resolved by 6 to 8 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Clonidine, used alone or with methylphenidate, appears safe and well tolerated in childhood ADHD. Physicians prescribing clonidine should monitor for bradycardia and advise patients about the high likelihood of initial drowsiness.",1,0,1,0

"Glial activation and post-synaptic neurotoxicity: the key events in Streptozotocin (ICV) induced memory impairment in rats. In the present study the role of glial activation and post synaptic toxicity in ICV Streptozotocin (STZ) induced memory impaired rats was explored. In experiment set up 1: Memory deficit was found in Morris water maze test on 14-16 days after STZ (ICV; 3mg/Kg) administration. STZ causes increased expression of GFAP, CD11b and TNF-a indicating glial activation and neuroinflammation. STZ also significantly increased the level of ROS, nitrite, Ca(2+) and reduced the mitochondrial activity in synaptosomal preparation illustrating free radical generation and excitotoxicity. Increased expression and activity of Caspase-3 was also observed in STZ treated rat which specify apoptotic cell death in hippocampus and cortex. STZ treatment showed decrease expression of post synaptic markers CaMKIIa and PSD-95, while, expression of pre synaptic markers (synaptophysin and SNAP-25) remains unaltered indicating selective post synaptic neurotoxicity. Oral treatment with Memantine (10mg/kg) and Ibuprofen (50 mg/kg) daily for 13 days attenuated STZ induced glial activation, apoptotic cell death and post synaptic neurotoxicity in rat brain. Further, in experiment set up 2: where memory function was not affected i.e. 7-9 days after STZ treatment. The level of GFAP, CD11b, TNF-a, ROS and nitrite levels were increased. On the other hand, apoptotic marker, synaptic markers, mitochondrial activity and Ca(2+) levels remained unaffected. Collective data indicates that neuroinflammatory process and oxidative stress occurs earlier to apoptosis and does not affect memory function. Present study clearly suggests that glial activation and post synaptic neurotoxicity are the key factors in STZ induced memory impairment and neuronal cell death.",0,0,1,0

Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (52%), congenital heart disease (35%) with and without prior repair (71% and 29%, respectively), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (5%), valvular heart disease (3%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (5%). Patients were managed with cyclosporine and azathioprine. No prophylaxis with antilymphocyte globulin was used. Steroids were given to 39% of patients for refractory rejection, but weaning was always attempted and generally successful (64%). Five patients (14%) received maintenance steroids. Four patients died in the perioperative period and one died 4 months later. There have been no deaths related to rejection or infection. Average follow-up was 36 +/- 19 months (range 1 to 65 months). Cumulative survival is 88% at 5 years. In patients less than 7 years of age, rejection was monitored noninvasively. In the first postoperative month, 89% of patients were treated for rejection. Freedom from serious infections was 83% at 1 month and 65% at 1 year. Cytomegalovirus infections were treated successfully with ganciclovir in 11 patients. No impairment of growth was observed in children who underwent transplantation compared with a control population. Twenty-one patients (60%) have undergone annual catheterizations and no sign of graft atherosclerosis has been observed. Seizures occurred in five patients (14%) and hypertension was treated in 10 patients (28%). No patient was disabled and no lymphoproliferative disorder was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0,1,0
"BRCA1 required for transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function . Association of the BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51 and changes in the phosphorylation and cellular localization of the protein after exposure to DNA-damaging agents are consistent with a role for BRCA1 in DNA repair . Here , it is shown that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 are defective in the ability to carry out transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage , and are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide . These results suggest that BRCA1 participates , directly or indirectly , in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage . .",0,0,0,1

"Distribution of emerin and lamins in the heart and implications for Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Emerin is a nuclear membrane protein which is missing or defective in Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) . It is one member of a family of lamina-associated proteins which includes LAP1 , LAP2 and lamin B receptor ( LBR ) . A panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) has been mapped to six specific sites throughout the emerin molecule using phage-displayed peptide libraries and has been used to localize emerin in human and rabbit heart . Several mAbs against different emerin epitopes did not recognize intercalated discs in the heart , though they recognized cardiomyocyte nuclei strongly , both at the rim and in intranuclear spots or channels . A polyclonal rabbit antiserum against emerin did recognize both nuclear membrane and intercalated discs but , after affinity purification against a pure-emerin band on a western blot , it stained only the nuclear membrane . These results would not be expected if immunostaining at intercalated discs were due to a product of the emerin gene and , therefore , cast some doubt upon the hypothesis that cardiac defects in EDMD are caused by absence of emerin from intercalated discs . Although emerin was abundant in the membranes of cardiomyocyte nuclei , it was absent from many non-myocyte cells in the heart . This distribution of emerin was similar to that of lamin A , a candidate gene for an autosomal form of EDMD . In contrast , lamin B1 was absent from cardiomyocyte nuclei , showing that lamin B1 is not essential for localization of emerin to the nuclear lamina . Lamin B1 is also almost completely absent from skeletal muscle nuclei . In EDMD , the additional absence of lamin B1 from heart and skeletal muscle nuclei which already lack emerin may offer an alternative explanation of why these tissues are particularly affected . .",1,0,1,0
"Clinical evaluation on combined administration of oral prostacyclin analogue beraprost and phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol. Among various oral antiplatelets, a combination of a novel prostacyclin analogue beraprost (BPT) and a potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor cilostazol (CLZ) may result in untoward clinical effects due to possible synergistic elevation of intracellular cAMP (cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate). Thereby, a clinical study of the combined administration of the two agents was attempted. Twelve healthy volunteers were assigned to take BPT/CLZ in the following schedule; BPT: 40 micrograms at day 1 and 120 micrograms t.i.d. from day 7 to 14, CLZ: 200 mg t.i.d. from day 3 to 14. At various time intervals, physical examination and blood collection for ex vivo platelet aggregation and determination of intraplatelet cAMP were performed. Throughout the observation period, no significant alteration in vital signs was observed. Seven out of 12 subjects experienced headache of a short duration accompanying facial flush in one and nausea in one, especially after ingestion of CLZ. All of these symptoms, probably caused by the vasodilating effect of the two agents, were of mild degree and no special treatment was required. Intraplatelet cAMP content was gradually but significantly increased to 9.84 +/- 4.59 pmol per 10(9) platelets at day 14 in comparison with the initial value (6.87 +/- 2.25 pmol). The platelet aggregability was significantly suppressed at various time intervals but no additive or synergistic inhibitory effect by the combined administration was noted. In conclusion, the combined administration of BPT/CLZ is safe at doses used in the study, though the beneficial clinical effect of the combined administration has yet to be elucidated.",0,0,1,0

"Gonosomal mosaicism in myotonic dystrophy patients: involvement of mitotic events in (CTG)n repeat variation and selection against extreme expansion in sperm. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is caused by abnormal expansion of a polymorphic ( CTG ) n repeat , located in the DM protein kinase gene . We determined the ( CTG ) n repeat lengths in a broad range of tissue DNAs from patients with mild , classical , or congenital manifestation of DM . Differences in the repeat length were seen in somatic tissues from single DM individuals and twins . Repeats appeared to expand to a similar extent in tissues originating from the same embryonal origin . In most male patients carrying intermediate- or small-sized expansions in blood , the repeat lengths covered a markedly wider range in sperm . In contrast , male patients with large allele expansions in blood ( > 700 CTGs ) had similar or smaller repeats in sperm , when detectable . Sperm alleles with > 1 , 000 CTGs were not seen . We conclude that DM patients can be considered gonosomal mosaics , i . e e . , combined somatic and germ-line tissue mosaics . Most remarkably , we observed multiple cases where the length distributions of intermediate- or small-sized alleles in fathers sperm were significantly different from that in their offsprings blood . Our combined findings indicate that intergenerational length changes in the unstable CTG repeat are most likely to occur during early embryonic mitotic divisions in both somatic and germ-line tissue formation . Both the initial CTG length , the overall number of cell divisions involved in tissue formation , and perhaps a specific selection process in spermatogenesis may influence the dynamics of this process . A model explaining mitotic instability and sex-dependent segregation phenomena in DM manifestation is discussed",0,0,1,0
"Cyclosporine and tacrolimus-associated thrombotic microangiopathy. The development of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) associated with the use of cyclosporine has been well documented. Treatments have included discontinuation or reduction of cyclosporine dose with or without concurrent plasma exchange, plasma infusion, anticoagulation, and intravenous immunoglobulin G infusion. However, for recipients of organ transplantation, removing the inciting agent is not without the attendant risk of precipitating acute rejection and graft loss. The last decade has seen the emergence of tacrolimus as a potent immunosuppressive agent with mechanisms of action virtually identical to those of cyclosporine. As a result, switching to tacrolimus has been reported to be a viable therapeutic option in the setting of cyclosporine-induced TMA. With the more widespread application of tacrolimus in organ transplantation, tacrolimus-associated TMA has also been recognized. However, literature regarding the incidence of the recurrence of TMA in patients exposed sequentially to cyclosporine and tacrolimus is limited. We report a case of a living donor renal transplant recipient who developed cyclosporine-induced TMA that responded to the withdrawal of cyclosporine in conjunction with plasmapheresis and fresh frozen plasma replacement therapy. Introduction of tacrolimus as an alternative immunosuppressive agent resulted in the recurrence of TMA and the subsequent loss of the renal allograft. Patients who are switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus or vice versa should be closely monitored for the signs and symptoms of recurrent TMA.",0,1,1,0

"Prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine-mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor binding. Epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophrenia. The goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophrenia. We report that prenatally protein deprived (PD) female rats showed an increased stereotypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adulthood. These differences were not observed during puberty. No changes in haloperidol-induced catalepsy or MK-801-induced locomotion were seen following PD. In addition, PD female rats showed increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus, but not in the cortex. PD female rats also showed increased (3)H-haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in striatum. No statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in PD males with the exception of increased (3)H-MK-801 binding in cortex. This animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse.",0,0,1,0

"The human complement C9 gene: identification of two mutations causing deficiency and revision of the gene structure. The ninth component of human complement ( C9 ) is the last of the terminal complement components creating the membrane attack complex . C9 is a single-chain serum protein that is encoded by a gene located on chromosome 5p . Deficiency of terminal complement components is generally associated with recurrent neisseria infections . We studied a previously described Swiss family with inherited C9 deficiency . To identify the genetic basis of C9 deficiency , we developed an approach using exon-specific PCR and direct DNA sequencing . As a cause of C9 deficiency , we found two different point mutations , both generating TGA stop codons in the coding sequence . One mutation , a C to A exchange , was detected in exon 2 at cDNA position 166 , the other , a C to T exchange , was located in exon 4 ( cDNA position 464 ) . In family studies of three first-degree relatives with heterozygous C9 deficiency , we demonstrated that the two mutations are segregating independently . Therefore , these mutations are sufficient to explain the complete deficiency of both the probands studied . DNA sequencing of the exon-intron junctions revealed a number of revisions regarding the boundaries between exons 4 , 5 , and 6 as well as between exons 10 and 11 . No additional introns were detected in exons 6 and 10 .

"Ashkenazi Jewish population frequencies for common mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the two major identified causes of inherited breast cancer , with mutations in either gene conferring up to 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer in carrier females . Mutations in BRCA1 account for approximately 45 % of familial breast cancer and 90 % of inherited breast / ovarian cancer , whereas mutations in BRCA2 account for a comparable percentage of inherited breast cancer cases . Over 85 distinct BRCA1 mutations and a growing list of BRCA2 mutations have been identified , with the majority resulting in protein truncation . A specific BRCA1 mutation , 185delAG , has a reported increased carrier frequency of approximately 0 . 9 % in the Ashkenazi Jewish population , but is also found in rare non-Jewish patients with a different haplotype . The 6174delT mutation in BRCA2 was recently identified as a frequent mutation in 8 out of 107 Ashkenazi Jewish women diagnosed with breast cancer by age 50 ( ref . 8 ) , as well as in three Ashkenazi male breast cancer patients . We have conducted a large-scale population study to investigate the prevalence of specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals who were unselected for breast cancer . BRCA1 mutation screening on approximately 3 , 000 Ashkenazi Jewish samples determined a carrier frequency of 1 . 09 % for the 185delAG mutation and 0 . 13 % for the 5382insC mutation .

"A diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency. The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross-sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine. After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity (day 0), animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets (12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period) for 21 days. Locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access. Beginning on day 22, all rats were maintained on ad libitum chow. Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups (ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection, cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection, ad libitum chow with amphetamine, or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection). These results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces bingeing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine, possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system.",0,0,1,0

"Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. BACKGROUND: Coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the United States. In 2002, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. PURPOSE: To determine the benefits and harms of taking aspirin for the primary prevention of myocardial infarctions, strokes, and death. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and Cochrane Library (search dates, 1 January 2001 to 28 August 2008), recent systematic reviews, reference lists of retrieved articles, and suggestions from experts. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); case-control studies; meta-analyses; and systematic reviews of aspirin versus control for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) were selected to answer the following questions: Does aspirin decrease coronary heart events, strokes, death from coronary heart events or stroke, or all-cause mortality in adults without known CVD? Does aspirin increase gastrointestinal bleeding or hemorrhagic strokes? DATA EXTRACTION: All studies were reviewed, abstracted, and rated for quality by using predefined USPSTF criteria. DATA SYNTHESIS: New evidence from 1 good-quality RCT, 1 good-quality meta-analysis, and 2 fair-quality subanalyses of RCTs demonstrates that aspirin use reduces the number of CVD events in patients without known CVD. Men in these studies experienced fewer myocardial infarctions and women experienced fewer ischemic strokes. Aspirin does not seem to affect CVD mortality or all-cause mortality in either men or women. The use of aspirin for primary prevention increases the risk for major bleeding events, primarily gastrointestinal bleeding events, in both men and women. Men have an increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes with aspirin use. A new RCT and meta-analysis suggest that the risk for hemorrhagic strokes in women is not statistically significantly increased. LIMITATIONS: New evidence on aspirin for the primary prevention of CVD is limited. The dose of aspirin used in the RCTs varied, which prevented the estimation of the most appropriate dose for primary prevention. Several of the RCTs were conducted within populations of health professionals, which potentially limits generalizability. CONCLUSION: Aspirin reduces the risk for myocardial infarction in men and strokes in women. Aspirin use increases the risk for serious bleeding events.",1,0,1,0
"Human and canine ventricular vasoactive intestinal polypeptide: decrease with heart failure. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a systemic and coronary vasodilator that may have positive inotropic properties. Myocardial levels of VIP were assayed before and after the development of heart failure in two canine models. In the first, cobalt cardiomyopathy was induced in eight dogs; VIP (by radioimmunoassay) decreased from 35 +/- 11 pg/mg protein (mean +/- SD) to 5 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In six dogs with doxorubicin-induced heart failure, VIP decreased from 31 +/- 7 to 11 +/- 4 pg/mg protein (P less than 0.05). In addition, VIP content of left ventricular muscle of resected failing hearts in 10 patients receiving a heart transplant was compared with the papillary muscles in 14 patients (five with rheumatic disease, nine with myxomatous degeneration) receiving mitral valve prostheses. The lowest myocardial VIP concentration was found in the hearts of patients with coronary disease (one patient receiving a transplant and three receiving mitral prostheses) (6.3 +/- 1.9 pg/mg protein). The other patients undergoing transplantation had an average ejection fraction of 17% +/- 6% and a VIP level of 8.8 +/- 3.9 pg/mg protein. The hearts without coronary artery disease (average ejection fraction of this group 62% +/- 10%) had a VIP concentration of 14.1 +/- 7.9 pg/mg protein, and this was greater than in hearts of the patients with coronary disease and the hearts of patients receiving a transplant (P less than 0.05).

"High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium. Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare, progressive and incurable disease, which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs. The importance of this association was evaluated in Belgium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite suppressants. Thirty-five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months (1992-1994) in Belgium. Exposure to appetite-suppressants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview. Twenty-three of the patients had previously taken appetite suppressants, mainly fenfluramines, as compared with only 5 of the controls (66 versus 6%, p<0.0001). Five patients died before the interview, all of them had taken appetite suppressants. In 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain, 5 of them had taken appetite suppressants. The patients who had been exposed to appetite suppressants tended to be on average more severely ill, and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diagnosis. A policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite suppressants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hypertension.

"Pallidal stimulation: an alternative to pallidotomy?. A resurgence of interest in the surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) came with the rediscovery of posteroventral pallidotomy by Laitinen in 1985. Laitinen's procedure improved most symptoms in drug-resistant PD, which engendered wide interest in the neurosurgical community. Another lesioning procedure, ventrolateral thalamotomy, has become a powerful alternative to stimulate the nucleus ventralis intermedius, producing high long-term success rates and low morbidity rates. Pallidal stimulation has not met with the same success. According to the literature pallidotomy improves the ""on"" symptoms of PD, such as dyskinesias, as well as the ""off"" symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia, and on-off fluctuations. Pallidal stimulation improves bradykinesia and rigidity to a minor extent; however, its strength seems to be in improving levodopa-induced dyskinesias. Stimulation often produces an improvement in the hyper- or dyskinetic upper limbs, but increases the ""freezing"" phenomenon in the lower limbs at the same time. Considering the small increase in the patient's independence, the high costs of bilateral implants, and the difficulty most patients experience in handling the devices, the question arises as to whether bilateral pallidal stimulation is a real alternative to pallidotomy.",0,0,1,0
"Nitro-L-arginine methyl ester: a potential protector against gentamicin ototoxicity. The nitric oxide (NO) inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) may act as an otoprotectant against high-frequency hearing loss caused by gentamicin, but further studies are needed to confirm this.Aminoglycoside antibiotics are still widely used by virtue of their efficacy and low cost. Their ototoxicity is a serious health problem and, as their ototoxic mechanism involves the production of NO, we need to assess the use of NO inhibitors for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced sensorineural hearing loss. In this experimental study we used 30 Sprague-Dawley rats, 27 of which had gentamicin instilled into the middle ear. The otoprotectant L-NAME was administered topically to 12/27 animals. Its effect was determined in terms of attenuation of hearing loss, measured by shifts in the auditory brainstem response threshold.

"Cardiac Na(+) channel dysfunction in Brugada syndrome is aggravated by beta(1)-subunit. BACKGROUND  Mutations in the gene encoding the human cardiac Na ( + ) channel alpha-subunit ( hH1 ) are responsible for chromosome 3-linked congenital long-QT syndrome ( LQT3 ) and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation ( IVF ) . An auxiliary beta ( 1 ) -subunit , widely expressed in excitable tissues , shifts the voltage dependence of steady-state inactivation toward more negative potentials and restores normal gating kinetics of brain and skeletal muscle Na ( + ) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes but has little if any functional effect on the cardiac isoform . Here , we characterize the altered effects of a human beta ( 1 ) -subunit ( hbeta ( 1 ) ) on the heterologously expressed hH1 mutation ( T1620M ) previously associated with IVF . METHODS AND RESULTS  When expressed alone in Xenopus oocytes , T1620M exhibited no persistent currents , in contrast to the LQT3 mutant channels , but the midpoint of steady-state inactivation ( V ( 1 / 2 ) ) was significantly shifted toward more positive potentials than for wild-type hH1 . Coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) did not significantly alter current decay or recovery from inactivation of wild-type hH1 ; however , it further shifted the V ( 1 / 2 ) and accelerated the recovery from inactivation of T1620M . Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed that the activation kinetics of T1620M were normal . CONCLUSIONS  It is suggested that coexpression of hbeta ( 1 ) exposes a more severe functional defect that results in a greater overlap in the relationship between channel inactivation and activation ( window current ) in T1620M , which is proposed to be a potential pathophysiological mechanism of IVF in vivo . One possible explanation for our finding is an altered alpha- / beta ( 1 ) -subunit association in the mutant . .",0,0,1,0

"Mechanisms Underlying Latent Disease Risk Associated with Early-Life Arsenic Exposure: Current Research Trends and Scientific Gaps. BACKGROUND: Millions of individuals worldwide, particularly those living in rural and developing areas, are exposed to harmful levels of inorganic arsenic (iAs) in their drinking water. Inorganic As exposure during key developmental periods is associated with a variety of adverse health effects including those that are evident in adulthood. There is considerable interest in identifying the molecular mechanisms that relate early-life iAs exposure to the development of these latent diseases, particularly in relationship to cancer. OBJECTIVES: This work summarizes research on the molecular mechanisms that underlie the increased risk of cancer development in adulthood that is associated with early-life iAs exposure. DISCUSSION: Epigenetic reprogramming that imparts functional changes in gene expression, the development of cancer stem cells, and immunomodulation are plausible underlying mechanisms by which early-life iAs exposure elicits latent carcinogenic effects. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence is mounting that relates early-life iAs exposure and cancer development later in life.

Mutations in the brain specific P / Q type Ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene , CACNA1A , have been identified in three clinically distinct disorders , viz . episodic ataxia type 2 ( EA-2 ) , familial hemiplegic migraine ( FHM ) and spinocerebellar ataxia 6 ( SCA6 ) . For individuals with EA-2 , the mutations described thus far are presumed to result in a truncated protein product . Several different missense mutations have been identified in patients with FHM . At least two of these mutations have been identified on two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes and thus represent recurrent mutations . In the present study , we have screened several individuals for mutations in all 47 exons in the CACNA1A gene by single-strand conformation analysis . We have characterised a novel missense mutation , G5260A , in exon 32 in a family segregating for EA-2 . The consequence of this mutation is an amino acid substitution at a highly conserved position within the CACNA1A gene . This represents the first point mutation not resulting in a proposed truncated protein . Furthermore , this mutation has been detected in a family member with mild clinical signs including only migraine . Additionally , a second previously identified recurrent muta tion , C2272T , in exon 16 has been discovered in a patient with FHM . .",0,0,1,0

"Initial potassium loss and hypokalaemia during chlorthalidone administration in patients with essential hypertension: the influence of dietary sodium restriction. To investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypokalaemia during the administration of an oral diuretic, metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypokalaemia under prior oral diuretic treatment. Chlorthalidone (50 mg daily) was given for 14 days. Six patients received a normal-sodium diet and four a low-sodium (17 mmol/day) diet. All patients had a normal initial total body potassium (40K). The electrolyte balances, weight, bromide space, plasma renin activity, and aldosterone secretion rate were measured. In both groups a potassium deficit developed, with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment. In the normal-sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9, after which some potassium was regained; in the low-sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13. The normal-sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels; in the low-sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elevated. It is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic-induced potassium loss, presumably by an increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion.",1,1,0,0
"Persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atracurium in the absence of corticosteroids. Neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinuance of these drugs have most often involved aminosteroid-based NMBAs such as vecuronium bromide, especially when used in conjunction with corticosteroids. Atracurium besylate, a short-acting benzylisoquinolinium NMBA that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function, has also been associated with persistent paralysis, but only when used with corticosteroids. We report a case of atracurium-related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids.",0,1,1,0

"Erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin. OBJECTIVE: To report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by ampicillin. CASE SUMMARY: A 13-year-old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septicemia. Medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occurred. The patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually improved. Macrophage-migration inhibition (MIF) test with ampicillin was positive. DISCUSSION: After most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out, a drug-induced allergic reaction was suspected.

"Halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross-react with halothane-induced antibodies. Two halogenated anesthetics, enflurane and isoflurane, have been associated with an allergic-type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to halothane. Halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune response. An antibody response to a protein-bound biotransformation product (trifluoroacetyl adduct) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patients. This study was performed to determine cross-reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by halothane. The subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neoantigens recognized by halothane-induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane, and the biochemical nature of these neoantigens was investigated in two animal models. Enflurane administration resulted in neoantigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centrilobular region of the liver. In the same liver, biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20-fold greater in guinea pigs than in rats. This supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and/or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administration. The guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens.",0,1,0,0

"Phenotypic characterization of individuals with 30-40 CAG repeats in the Huntington disease (HD) gene reveals HD cases with 36 repeats and apparently normal elderly individuals with 36-39 repeats. Abnormal CAG expansions in the IT-15 gene are associated with Huntington disease ( HD ) . In the diagnostic setting it is necessary to define the limits of the CAG size ranges on normal and HD-associated chromosomes . Most large analyses that defined the limits of the normal and pathological size ranges employed PCR assays , which included the CAG repeats and a CCG repeat tract that was thought to be invariant . Many of these experiments found an overlap between the normal and disease size ranges . Subsequent findings that the CCG repeats vary by 8 trinucleotide lengths suggested that the limits of the normal and disease size ranges should be reevaluated with assays that exclude the CCG polymorphism . Since patients with between 30 and 40 repeats are rare , a consortium was assembled to collect such individuals . All 178 samples were reanalyzed in Cambridge by using assays specific for the CAG repeats . We have optimized methods for reliable sizing of CAG repeats and show cases that demonstrate the dangers of using PCR assays that include both the CAG and CCG polymorphisms . Seven HD patients had 36 repeats , which confirms that this allele is associated with disease . Individuals without apparent symptoms or signs of HD were found at 36 repeats ( aged 74 , 78 , 79 , and 87 years ) , 37 repeats ( aged 69 years ) , 38 repeats ( aged 69 and 90 years ) , and 39 repeats ( aged 67 , 90 , and 95 years ) . The detailed case histories of an exceptional case from this series will be presented  a 95-year-old man with 39 repeats who did not have classical features of HD . The apparently healthy survival into old age of some individuals with 36-39 repeats suggests that the HD mutation may not always be fully penetrant . .",0,0,1,0

"A potential animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome through introduction of HPRT mutations into mice. The human Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is a rare neurological and behavioural disorder , affecting only males , which is caused by an inherited deficiency in the level of activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanosine phosphoribosyl transferase ( HPRT ) . How the resulting alterations in purine metabolism lead to the severe symptoms characteristic of Lesch-Nyhan patients is still not understood . No mutations at the Hprt locus leading to loss of activity have been described in laboratory animals . To derive an animal model for the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome , we have used cultured mouse embryonic stem cells , mutagenized by retroviral insertion and selected for loss of HPRT activity , to construct chimaeric mice . Two clonal lines carrying different mutant Hprt alleles have given rise to germ cells in chimaeras , allowing the derivation of strains of mutant mice having the same biochemical defect as Lesch-Nyhan patients . Male mice carrying the mutant alleles are viable and analysis of their cells shows a total lack of HPRT activity . .",0,0,1,0

A fourth mutation , 433 --2 ( A-- > G ) transition , was identified at the splice-acceptor site in intron 2 . The splice-site mutation would lead to skipping of exon 3 , accompanied by a frameshift , and thus would produce aberrant ASPA .

"Dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ecstasy users. Sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consolidation. Previous studies indicate that ecstasy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep-related impairments. We extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ecstasy users (n=12) and drug naive healthy controls (n=26). Memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep, with and without interference prior to testing. In addition, we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning, memory and executive functioning. Ecstasy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation, a finding that was more pronounced following associative interference. Additionally, ecstasy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting frontostriatal and hippocampal neural circuitry, in the domains of proactive interference memory, long-term memory, encoding, working memory and complex planning. We suggest that ecstasy-associated dysfunction in fronto-temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ecstasy users.",0,0,1,0

"Electron microscopic investigations of the cyclophosphamide-induced lesions of the urinary bladder of the rat and their prevention by mesna. Fully developed cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the urothelium, severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle necroses. The initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membrane. This damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic urine. Subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells, intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desmosomes and hemidesmosomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membrane. The morphological changes of the endothelial cells, which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment, the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location-dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator-induced increase in permeability, the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the interendothelial cell connections on the venules. These changes can be effectively prevented by mesna. The only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells.",0,0,1,0
"Increased sulfation and decreased 7alpha-hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in ethinyl estradiol-induced cholestasis in rats. Deoxycholic acid conjugation, transport capacity, and metabolism were compared in control and ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than taurodeoxycholic acid, and both were decreased by ethinyl estradiol treatment. During [24-14C]sodium deoxycholate infusion, [14C]biliary bile acid secretion increased, but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or ethinyl estradiol-treated rats. Ethinyl estradiol-treated animals excreted significantly less 14C as taurocholic acid than did control animals, consistent with an impairment of 7alpha-hydroxylation of taurodeoxycholic acid. Ethinyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid, but did result in an increase in sulfation of taurodeoxycholic acid from 1.5% in controls to nearly 4.0% (P less than 0.01). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other species. Furthermore, the rat converts deoxycholic acid, a poor choleretic, to taurocholic acid, a good choleretic. When this conversion is impaired with ethinyl estradiol treatment, sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid.",0,1,0,0

"Aminoglycoside antibiotics restore dystrophin function to skeletal muscles of mdx mice. Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene , leading to the absence of the dystrophin protein in striated muscle . A significant number of these mutations are premature stop codons . On the basis of the observation that aminoglycoside treatment can suppress stop codons in cultured cells , we tested the effect of gentamicin on cultured muscle cells from the mdx mouse - an animal model for DMD that possesses a premature stop codon in the dystrophin gene . Exposure of mdx myotubes to gentamicin led to the expression and localization of dystrophin to the cell membrane . We then evaluated the effects of differing dosages of gentamicin on expression and functional protection of the muscles of mdx mice . We identified a treatment regimen that resulted in the presence of dystrophin in the cell membrane in all striated muscles examined and that provided functional protection against muscular injury . To our knowledge , our results are the first to demonstrate that aminoglycosides can suppress stop codons not only in vitro but also in vivo . Furthermore , these results raise the possibility of a novel treatment regimen for muscular dystrophy and other diseases caused by premature stop codon mutations . This treatment could prove effective in up to 15 % of patients with DMD . .",0,0,1,0

"Nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead-induced hypertension. We recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced urinary excretion of NO metabolites (NOx), and increased NO sequestration as nitrotyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead-induced hypertension. This study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary NOx in lead-induced hypertension is, in part, due to depressed NO synthase (NOS) expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a lead-treated group (given lead acetate, 100 ppm, in drinking water and regular rat chow), a group given lead and vitamin E-fortified chow, or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin E-fortified food for 12 weeks. Tail blood pressure, urinary NOx excretion, plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), and endothelial and inducible NOS (eNOS and iNOS) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measured. The lead-treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma MDA concentration, a fall in urinary NOx excretion, and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation ameliorated hypertension, lowered plasma MDA concentration, and raised urinary NOx excretion while significantly lowering vascular, but not renal, tissue eNOS and iNOS expression. Vitamin E supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure, plasma MDA, or NOS expression in the control group. The study also revealed significant inhibition of NOS enzymatic activity by lead in cell-free preparations. In conclusion, lead-induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular eNOS and iNOS expression. This is, in part, due to ROS-mediated NO inactivation, lead-associated inhibition of NOS activity, and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension.",1,1,0,0

"In vivo protection of dna damage associated apoptotic and necrotic cell deaths during acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone-induced lung toxicity and doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity by a novel IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract. Grape seed extract, primarily a mixture of proanthocyanidins, has been shown to modulate a wide-range of biological, pharmacological and toxicological effects which are mainly cytoprotective. This study assessed the ability of IH636 grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE) to prevent acetaminophen (AAP)-induced nephrotoxicity, amiodarone (AMI)-induced lung toxicity, and doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. Experimental design consisted of four groups: control (vehicle alone), GSPE alone, drug alone and GSPE+drug. For the cytoprotection study, animals were orally gavaged 100 mg/Kg GSPE for 7-10 days followed by i.p. injections of organ specific three drugs (AAP: 500 mg/Kg for 24 h; AMI: 50 mg/Kg/day for four days; DOX: 20 mg/Kg for 48 h). Parameters of study included analysis of serum chemistry (ALT, BUN and CPK), and orderly fragmentation of genomic DNA (both endonuclease-dependent and independent) in addition to microscopic evaluation of damage and/or protection in corresponding PAS stained tissues. Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP, AMI and DOX, provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes (ALT, BUN and CPK), and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation. Histopathological examination of kidney, heart and lung sections revealed moderate to massive tissue damage with a variety of morphological aberrations by all the three drugs in the absence of GSPE preexposure than in its presence. GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery. Additionally, histopathological alterations mirrored both serum chemistry changes and the pattern of DNA fragmentation. Interestingly, all the drugs, such as, AAP, AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE. Since AAP, AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo, the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals. In addition, its' presumed contribution to DNA repair may be another important attribute, which played a role in the chemoprevention process. Additionally, this may have been the first report on AMI-induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue. Taken together, these events undoubtedly establish GSPE's abundant bioavailability, and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo.",1,1,1,0

Thyroid function and urine-concentrating ability during lithium treatment. It has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treatment. We measured serum thyroxine and urine-concentrating ability (Umax) in response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 85 patients receiving lithium. Hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithium. Impaired Umax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well. It is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different.,0,1,1,0

We have used in situ hybridisation with MCT112 , a corresponding cosmid MJ1 , and DR47 ( D9S5 ) , coupled with mapping studies on hybrid cell panels , to define more precisely the location of the disease locus . The in situ location of all three probes is 9q13----q21 . 1 , distal to the variable heterochromatin region . Physical assignment of FRDA will allow us to identify hybrid cell lines containing the mutated gene .",0,0,1,0
"In vivo evidences suggesting the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of vancomycin-induced nephrotoxicity: protection by erdosteine. The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin (VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to investigate the role of erdosteine, an expectorant agent, which has also antioxidant properties, on kidney tissue against the possible VCM-induced renal impairment in rats. Rats were divided into three groups: sham, VCM and VCM plus erdosteine. VCM was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 200mgkg(-1) twice daily for 7 days. Erdosteine was administered orally. VCM administration to control rats significantly increased renal malondialdehyde (MDA) and urinary N-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (NAG, a marker of renal tubular injury) excretion but decreased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities. Erdosteine administration with VCM injections caused significantly decreased renal MDA and urinary NAG excretion, and increased SOD activity, but not CAT activity in renal tissue when compared with VCM alone. Erdosteine showed histopathological protection against VCM-induced nephrotoxicity. There were a significant dilatation of tubular lumens, extensive epithelial cell vacuolization, atrophy, desquamation, and necrosis in VCM-treated rats more than those of the control and the erdosteine groups. Erdosteine caused a marked reduction in the extent of tubular damage. It is concluded that oxidative tubular damage plays an important role in the VCM-induced nephrotoxicity and the modulation of oxidative stress with erdosteine reduces the VCM-induced kidney damage both at the biochemical and histological levels.",0,1,1,0

"Ascending dose tolerance study of intramuscular carbetocin administered after normal vaginal birth. OBJECTIVE: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carbetocin (a long-acting synthetic analogue of oxytocin), when administered immediately after vaginal delivery at term. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carbetocin was given as an intramuscular injection immediately after the birth of the infant in 45 healthy women with normal singleton pregnancies who delivered vaginally at term. Dosage groups of 15, 30, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175 or 200 microg carbetocin were assigned to blocks of three women according to the continual reassessment method (CRM). RESULTS: All dosage groups consisted of three women, except those with 100 microg (n=6) and 200 microg (n=18). Recorded were dose-limiting adverse events: hyper- or hypotension (three), severe abdominal pain (0), vomiting (0) and retained placenta (four). Serious adverse events occurred in seven women: six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml, four cases of manual placenta removal, five cases of additional oxytocics administration and five cases of blood transfusion. Maximum blood loss was greatest at the upper and lower dose levels, and lowest in the 70-125 microg dose range. Four out of six cases with blood loss > or = 1000 ml occurred in the 200 microg group. The majority of additional administration of oxytocics (4/5) and blood transfusion (3/5) occurred in the dose groups of 200 microg. All retained placentae were found in the group of 200 microg. CONCLUSION: The MTD was calculated to be at 200 microg carbetocin.",0,1,0,0
"Myocardial Fas ligand expression increases susceptibility to AZT-induced cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND: Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and myocarditis occur in many HIV-infected individuals, resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5% of patients. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal myopathies. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to investigate whether the HAART component zidovudine (3'-azido-2',3'-deoxythymidine; AZT) triggers the Fas-dependent cell-death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of DCM, 8-week-old transgenic (expressing Fas ligand in the myocardium: FasL Tg) and non-transgenic (NTg) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of AZT (0, 0.07, 0.2, and 0.7 mg/ml). After 6 weeks, cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical methods. NTg and untreated FasL Tg mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function. In contrast, AZT-treated FasL Tg mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose-dependent manner, with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventricles. These changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of Fas and FasL, as well as increased activation of caspase 3, translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere, and increased numbers of cells undergoing apoptosis. These were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin I localization, as well as loss of sarcolemmal integrity. CONCLUSIONS: The expression of Fas ligand in the myocardium, as identified in HIV-positive patients, might increase the susceptibility to HAART-induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways, resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction.",1,0,0,0

"Prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMCs) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rats. BMCs obtained from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus (SE). Spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) were monitored using Racine's seizure severity scale. All of the rats in the saline-treated epileptic control group developed SRS, whereas none of the BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term (15 days after transplantation), regardless of the BMC source. Over the long-term chronic phase (120 days after transplantation), only 25% of BMC-treated epileptic animals had seizures, but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control group. The density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with BMCs was markedly preserved. At hippocampal Schaeffer collateral-CA1 synapses, long-term potentiation was preserved in BMC-transplanted rats compared to epileptic controls. The donor-derived GFP(+) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rats. In conclusion, treatment with BMCs can prevent the development of chronic seizures, reduce neuronal loss, and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network.",0,0,1,0
"Reversal of severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and excellent neuropsychologic outcome in very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. Very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency is a disorder of fatty acid beta oxidation that reportedly has high rates of morbidity and mortality . We describe the outcome of a 5-year-old girl with VLCAD deficiency who was first seen at 5 months of age with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , hepatomegaly , encephalopathy , and hypotonia . Biochemical studies indicated VLCAD deficiency caused by a stable yet inactive enzyme . Molecular genetic analysis of her VLCAD gene revealed a T1372C ( F458L ) missense mutation and a 1668 ACAG 1669 splice site mutation . After initial treatment with intravenous glucose and carnitine , the patient has thrived on a low-fat diet supplemented with medium-chain triglyceride oil and carnitine and avoidance of fasting . Her ventricular hypertrophy resolved significantly over 1 year , and cognitively , she is in the superior range for age . Clinical recognition of VLCAD deficiency is important because it is one of the few directly treatable causes of cardiomyopathy in children . .",1,0,1,0

"Cloning of the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase gene, the key enzyme of alkaptonuria in mouse. We determined 48 amino acid residues from five peptides from the homogeneous monomer of homogentisate 1 , 2-dioxygenase ( HGO ; E . C . 1 . 13 . 11 . 15 ) of mouse liver . After digestion with trypsin , peptides were separated by reversed phase chromatography and amino acid sequenced . The deduced codon sequence of three peptides was used to derive degenerated oligomeres . By combining these oligos , we were able to amplify fragments from 100 to 300 bases ( b ) from mouse liver cDNA by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription ( RT-PCR ) . A fragment of 200 b was cloned and used as a probe to screen a mouse liver cDNA library . One clone from this library contained the complete cDNA-insert for HGO as determined by sequencing . The cDNA encodes for a protein of 50 kDa , as predicted . The cDNA of mouse HGO has an overall identity of 41 % to the corresponding gene hmgA from Aspergillus . Sequence similarities to human expressed sequence tags ( EST ) clones ranged from 70 % to 20 % . The positions of 122 conserved amino acids could be determined by multiple sequence alignment . We identified one first intron of 928 b in the mouse gene . The gene for HGO seems to be expressed in various tissues , as shown by RT-PCR on different cDNAs . FISH experiments with the whole murine cDNA as probe clearly revealed signals at the human chromosomal band 3q13 . 3-q21 . This corresponds well to the previous assignment of the locus for the human alkaptonuria gene ( AKU ) to the same chromosomal region by multipoint linkage analysis . We therefore conclude that the HGO cDNA encodes the gene responsible for alkaptonuria .",0,1,1,0

"Efficacy of everolimus (RAD001) in patients with advanced NSCLC previously treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors. BACKGROUND: Treatment options are scarce in pretreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. RAD001, an oral inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), has shown phase I efficacy in NSCLC. METHODS: Stage IIIb or IV NSCLC patients, with two or fewer prior chemotherapy regimens, one platinum based (stratum 1) or both chemotherapy and epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (stratum 2), received RAD001 10 mg/day until progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary objective was overall response rate (ORR). Analyses of markers associated with the mTOR pathway were carried out on archival tumor from a subgroup using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and direct mutation sequencing. RESULTS: Eighty-five patients were enrolled, 42 in stratum 1 and 43 in stratum. ORR was 4.7% (7.1% stratum 1; 2.3% stratum 2). Overall disease control rate was 47.1%. Median progression-free survivals (PFSs) were 2.6 (stratum 1) and 2.7 months (stratum 2). Common > or =grade 3 events were fatigue, dyspnea, stomatitis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Pneumonitis, probably or possibly related, mainly grade 1/2, occurred in 25%. Cox regression analysis of IHC scores found that only phospho AKT (pAKT) was a significant independent predictor of worse PFS. CONCLUSIONS: RAD001 10 mg/day was well tolerated, showing modest clinical activity in pretreated NSCLC. Evaluation of RAD001 plus standard therapy for metastatic NSCLC continues.",0,0,0,1

"Structural analysis of the 5' region of mouse and human Huntington disease genes reveals conservation of putative promoter region and di- and trinucleotide polymorphisms. We have previously cloned and characterized the murine homologue of the Huntington disease ( HD ) gene and shown that it maps to mouse chromosome 5 within a region of conserved synteny with human chromosome 4p16 . 3 3 . Here we present a detailed comparison of the sequence of the putative promoter and the organization of the 5 genomic region of the murine ( Hdh ) and human HD genes encompassing the first five exons . We show that in this region these two genes share identical exon boundaries , but have different-size introns . Two dinucleotide ( CT ) and one trinucleotide intronic polymorphism in Hdh and an intronic CA polymorphism in the HD gene were identified . Comparison of 940-bp sequence 5 to the putative translation start site reveals a highly conserved region ( 78 . 8 % nucleotide identity ) between Hdh and the HD gene from nucleotide -56 to -206 ( of Hdh ) . Neither Hdh nor the HD gene have typical TATA or CCAAT elements , but both show one putative AP2 binding site and numerous potential Sp1 binding sites . The high sequence identity between Hdh and the HD gene for approximately 200 bp 5 to the putative translation start site indicates that these sequences may play a role in regulating expression of the Huntington disease gene",0,0,1,0

"Risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography: a prospective study. Despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures, the studies in pediatrics are limited, with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angiography. This prospective study determined the incidence of CIN for two nonionic contrast media (CM), iopromide and iohexol, among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of CM and the presence of cyanosis. The 80 patients in the study consecutively received either iopromide (group A, n = 40) or iohexol (group B, n = 40). Serum sodium (Na), potassium (K), and creatinine (Cr) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values, then measured again at 12-, 24-, and 48-h intervals after CM use. Urine samples for Na and Cr also were checked at the same intervals. Risk of renal failure, Injury to the kidney, Failure of kidney function, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage renal damage (RIFLE criteria) were used to define CIN and its incidence in the study population. Accordingly, among the 15 CIN patients (18.75%), 7.5% of the patients in group A had increased risk and 3.75% had renal injury, whereas 5% of group B had increased risk and 2.5% had renal injury. Whereas 33.3% of the patients with CIN were among those who received the proper dosage of CM, the percentage increased to 66.6% among those who received larger doses, with a significant difference in the incidence of CIN related to the different dosages of CM (p = 0.014). Among the 15 patients with CIN, 6 had cyanotic congenital heart diseases, but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the noncyanotic patients (p = 0.243). Although clinically silent, CIN is not rare in pediatrics. The incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic CM, nor on the presence of cyanosis, and although CIN usually is reversible, more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children.",1,1,0,0

"The activation of spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neuraxial morphine after a noninjurious interval of spinal cord ischemia. We investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors after neuraxial morphine following a noninjurious interval of aortic occlusion in rats. Spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter. In a microdialysis study, 10 muL of saline (group C; n = 8) or 30 mug of morphine (group M; n = 8) was injected intrathecally (IT) 0.5 h after reflow, and 30 mug of morphine (group SM; n = 8) or 10 muL of saline (group SC; n = 8) was injected IT 0.5 h after sham operation. Microdialysis samples were collected preischemia, before IT injection, and at 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h of reperfusion (after IT injection). Second, we investigated the effect of IT MK-801 (30 mug) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis. After IT morphine, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glutamate concentration was increased in group M relative to both baseline and group C (P < 0.05). This increase persisted for 8 hrs. IT MK-801 significantly reduced the number of dark-stained alpha-motoneurons after morphine-induced spastic paraparesis compared with the saline group. These data indicate that IT morphine induces spastic paraparesis with a concomitant increase in CSF glutamate, which is involved in NMDA receptor activation. We suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via NMDA receptor activation.",1,0,1,0

"Dobutamine stress echocardiography: a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic doxorubicin-treated long-term survivors of childhood cancer. Doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomyopathy. To develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin, a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjects. Echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients (mean age 16 +/- 5 years) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years (median 5.3) before this study with 27 to 532 mg/m2 of doxorubicin (mean 196) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age-matched control subjects. Graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5, 2.5, 5 and 10 micrograms/kg per min were administered. Echocardiographic Doppler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rate. Dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms/kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50% incidence rate of adverse symptoms. The most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects, end-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin-treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimulation. End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin-treated group was 11 +/- 1.9 mm versus 13.1 +/- 1.5 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01). End-systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5-micrograms/kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin-treated group was 14.1 +/- 2.4 mm versus 19.3 +/- 2.6 mm for control subjects (p less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0,1,1

"A novel compound, maltolyl p-coumarate, attenuates cognitive deficits and shows neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo dementia models. To develop a novel and effective drug that could enhance cognitive function and neuroprotection, we newly synthesized maltolyl p-coumarate by the esterification of maltol and p-coumaric acid. In the present study, we investigated whether maltolyl p-coumarate could improve cognitive decline in scopolamine-injected rats and in amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. Maltolyl p-coumarate was found to attenuate cognitive deficits in both rat models using passive avoidance test and to reduce apoptotic cell death observed in the hippocampus of the amyloid beta peptide(1-42)-infused rats. We also examined the neuroprotective effects of maltolyl p-coumarate in vitro using SH-SY5Y cells. Cells were pretreated with maltolyl p-coumarate, before exposed to amyloid beta peptide(1-42), glutamate or H2O2. We found that maltolyl p-coumarate significantly decreased apoptotic cell death and reduced reactive oxygen species, cytochrome c release, and caspase 3 activation. Taking these in vitro and in vivo results together, our study suggests that maltolyl p-coumarate is a potentially effective candidate against Alzheimer's disease that is characterized by wide spread neuronal death and progressive decline of cognitive function.",0,0,1,0

"Progestational agents and blood coagulation. VII. Thromboembolic and other complications of oral contraceptive therapy in relationship to pretreatment levels of blood coagulation factors: summary report of a ten-year study. During a ten-year period, 348 women were studied for a total of 5,877 patient months in four separate studies relating oral contraceptives to changes in hematologic parameters. Significant increases in certain factors of the blood coagulation and fibrinolysin systems (factors I,II,VII,VIII,IX, and X and plasminogen) were observed in the treated groups. Severe complications developed in four patients. All four had an abnormal blood coagulation profile, suggesting ""hypercoagulability"" before initiation of therapy. Some of these findings represented the most extreme abnormalities seen in the entire group of patients; some increased further during therapy. One of these patients developed a myocardial infarction before receiving any medication, shortly after the base-line values were obtained. One patient developed retinopathy 19 months after she began therapy, and another developed thrombophlebitis after 27 months of therapy. The fourth patient developed thrombophlebitis 14 days after initiation of contraceptive therapy. All four patients were of the A or AB blood group. Previous studies suggested the possiblility of increased propensity for thromboembolic episodes in patients possessing the A antigen.

"A common human skin tumour is caused by activating mutations in beta-catenin. WNT signalling orchestrates a number of developmental programs . In response to this stimulus , cytoplasmic beta-catenin ( encoded by CTNNB1 ) is stabilized , enabling downstream transcriptional activation by members of the LEF / TCF family . One of the target genes for beta-catenin / TCF encodes c-MYC , explaining why constitutive activation of the WNT pathway can lead to cancer , particularly in the colon . Most colon cancers arise from mutations in the gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) , a protein required for ubiquitin-mediated degradation of beta-catenin , but a small percentage of colon and some other cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Recently , we discovered that transgenic mice expressing an activated beta-catenin are predisposed to developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas . Given that the skin of these adult mice also exhibits signs of de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis , we wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate from hair matrix cells and whether they might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations . Here , we explore the cell origin and aetiology of this common human skin tumour . We found nuclear LEF-1 in the dividing tumour cells , providing biochemical evidence that pilomatricomas are derived from hair matrix cells . At least 75 % of these tumours possess mutations affecting the amino-terminal segment , normally involved in phosphorylation-dependent , ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the protein .

In this respect, little is known about the role of DA receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy-induced neuronal cell death. Here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in D2R -/- mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pilocarpine. We compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid (KA), a potent glutamate agonist. Importantly, D2R -/- mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for WT littermates and show greater neurotoxicity. However, pilocarpine-induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both WT and D2R -/- brains in comparison to KA. Thus, the absence of D2R lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetylcholine. Moreover, the dopaminergic control of epilepsy-induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of D2R signaling with these two neurotransmitters.",0,0,1,0
"Succinylcholine apnoea: attempted reversal with anticholinesterases. Anticholinesterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succinylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholinesterase. Edrophonium 10 mg, given 74 min after succinylcholine, when train-of-four stimulation was characteristic of phase II block, produced partial antagonism which was not sustained. Repeated doses of edrophonium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the block. Spontaneous respiration recommenced 200 min after succinylcholine administration. It is concluded that anticholinesterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succinylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase II block.",0,0,1,0

"Chronic treatment with metformin suppresses toll-like receptor 4 signaling and attenuates left ventricular dysfunction following myocardial infarction. Acute treatment with metformin has a protective effect in myocardial infarction by suppression of inflammatory responses due to activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In the present study, the effect of chronic pre-treatment with metformin on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction and their relation with AMPK were assessed. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (n=6): normal control and groups were injected isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100mg/kg of metformin twice daily for 14 days. Isoproterenol (100mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously on the 13th and 14th days to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol alone decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility indexed as LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. The left ventricular dysfunction was significantly lower in the groups treated with 25 and 50mg/kg of metformin. Metfromin markedly lowered isoproterenol-induced elevation in the levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the heart tissues. Similar changes were also seen in the serum levels of TNF-a and IL-6. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50mg/kg were more effective than 100mg/kg. Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was significantly elevated by 25mg/kg of metformin, slightly by 50mg/kg, but not by 100mg/kg. Chronic pre-treatment with metformin reduces post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, possibly through inhibition of TLR4 activities. This mechanism can be considered as a target to protect infarcted myocardium.",1,0,0,1
"Detection of an unstable fragment of DNA specific to individuals with myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , with a prevalence of 2-14 per 100 , 000 individuals . The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and sustained muscle contraction , often with a wide range of accompanying symptoms . The age at onset and severity of the disease show extreme variation , both within and between families . Despite its clinical variability , this dominant condition segregates as a single locus at chromosome 19q13 . 3 in every population studied . It is flanked by the tightly linked genetic markers ERCC1 proximally and D19S51 distally ; these define the DM critical region . We report the isolation of an expressed sequence from this region which detects a DNA fragment that is larger in affected individuals than in normal siblings or unaffected controls . The size of this fragment varies between affected siblings , and increases in size through generations in parallel with increasing severity of the disease .

"High-dose methylprednisolone may do more harm for spinal cord injury. Because of the National Acute Spinal Cord Injury Studies (NASCIS), high-dose methylprednisolone became the standard of care for the acute spinal cord injury. In the NASCIS, there was no mention regarding the possibility of acute corticosteroid myopathy that high-dose methylprednisolone may cause. The dosage of methylprednisolone recommended by the NASCIS 3 is the highest dose of steroids ever being used during a 2-day period for any clinical condition. We hypothesize that it may cause some damage to the muscle of spinal cord injury patients. Further, steroid myopathy recovers naturally and the neurological improvement shown in the NASCIS may be just a recording of this natural motor recovery from the steroid myopathy, instead of any protection that methylprednisolone offers to the spinal cord injury. To our knowledge, this is the first discussion considering the possibility that the methylprednisolone recommended by NASCIS may cause acute corticosteroid myopathy.",0,0,1,0
"Identification of a novel nonsense mutation and a missense substitution in the vasopressin-neurophysin II gene in two Spanish kindreds with familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( FNDI ) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by deficiency in the antidiuretic hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) encoded by the AVP-neurophysin II ( AVP-NPII ) gene on chromosome 20p13 . In this study , we analyzed two families with FNDI using direct automated fluorescent , solid phase , single-stranded DNA sequencing of PCR-amplified AVP-NPII DNA . In one of the families , affected individuals presented a novel nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the gene , consisting in a G to T transition at nucleotide 2101 , which produces a stop signal in codon 82 ( Glu ) of NPII . The premature termination eliminates part of the C-terminal domain of NPII , including a cysteine residue in position 85 , which could be involved in the correct folding of the prohormone . In the second family , a G279A substitution at position -1 of the signal peptide was observed in all affected individuals . This missense mutation , which replaces Ala with Thr , is frequent among FNDI patients and is thought to reduce the efficiency of cleavage by signal peptidases . .",0,0,1,0

"Abnormal high density lipoproteins in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The plasma lipoprotein profiles and high density lipoproteins ( HDL ) were characterized in patients with the genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis ( CTX ) . Abnormalities in the HDL may contribute to their increased atherogenesis and excessive deposits of tissue sterols in the presence of low or low-normal concentrations of plasma cholesterol ( 165 + / - 25 mg / dl ) and low density lipoproteins ( LDL ) . The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration in the CTX plasmas was 14 . 5 + / - 3 . 2 mg / dl , about one-third the normal value . The low HDL-cholesterol reflects a low concentration and an abnormal lipid composition of the plasma HDL . Relative to normal HDL , the cholesteryl esters are low , free cholesterol and phospholipids essentially normal , and triglycerides increased . The ratio of apoprotein ( apo ) to total cholesterol in the HDL of CTX was two to three times greater than normal . In the CTX HDL , the ratio of apoAI to apoAII was high , the proportion of apoC low , and a normally minor form of apoAI increased relative to other forms . The HDL in electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically and in particle size . The abnormalities in lipoprotein distribution profile and composition of the plasma HDL result from metabolic defects that are not understood but may be linked to the genetic defect in bile acid synthesis in CTX . As a consequence , it is probable that the normal functions of the HDL , possibly including modulation of LDL-cholesterol uptake and the removal of excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues , are perturbed significantly in this disease .",0,0,1,0
"Preferential germline mutation of the paternal allele in retinoblastoma. The event triggering malignant proliferation in 70 % of retinoblastoma tumours is loss of heterozygosity for chromosome 13q14 , whereby the normal retinoblastoma gene ( RB1 ) allele is lost and an already mutated RB1 allele remains in the tumour . The first allele suffers a mutational event--deletion , duplication or point mutation ( manuscript in preparation ) --either in the germ line ( all bilateral patients ) or in a somatic retinal cell ( most unilateral patients ) . Most bilateral patients have no family history of retinoblastoma and are presumed to have new germline mutations which arose in the egg , sperm or early embryo . We have determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumours from eight unrelated non-familial cases by using RB1-linked genetic markers . Six tumours retained the paternal allele and three retained the maternal allele . Of the three unilateral tumours , only one retained the paternal RB1 allele . Thus , there is no evidence that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma , as has been suggested to be the case in osteosarcoma . By contrast , tumours from four of the five bilateral patients retained the paternal RB1 allele . This suggests either that new germline RB1 mutations arise more frequently during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis , or that imprinting in the early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility to mutation . .",0,0,0,1

"Frequency of transient ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. BACKGROUND: Especially because of improvements in clinical neurologic monitoring, carotid endarterectomy done under local anesthesia has become the technique of choice in several centers. Temporary ipsilateral vocal nerve palsies due to local anesthetics have been described, however. Such complications are most important in situations where there is a pre-existing contralateral paralysis. We therefore examined the effect of local anesthesia on vocal cord function to better understand its possible consequences. METHODS: This prospective study included 28 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia. Vocal cord function was evaluated before, during, and after surgery (postoperative day 1) using flexible laryngoscopy. Anesthesia was performed by injecting 20 to 40 mL of a mixture of long-acting (ropivacaine) and short-acting (prilocaine) anesthetic. RESULTS: All patients had normal vocal cord function preoperatively. Twelve patients (43%) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis. It resolved in all cases < or =24 hours. There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without. CONCLUSION: Local anesthesia led to temporary ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis in almost half of these patients. Because pre-existing paralysis is of a relevant frequency (up to 3%), a preoperative evaluation of vocal cord function before carotid endarterectomy under local anesthesia is recommended to avoid intraoperative bilateral paralysis. In patients with preoperative contralateral vocal cord paralysis, surgery under general anesthesia should be considered.",0,0,1,0

"The red-green visual pigment gene region in adrenoleukodystrophy. Although recent data established that a specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase is defective in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) , the ALD gene is still unidentified . The ALD locus has been mapped to Xq28 , like the red and green color pigment genes . Abnormal color vision has been observed in 12 of 27 patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) , a milder form of ALD . Furthermore , rearrangements of the color vision gene cluster were found in four of eight ALD kindreds . This led us to propose that a single DNA rearrangement could underlie both ALD and abnormal color vision in these patients . Study of 34 French ALD patients failed to reveal a higher than expected frequency of green / red visual pigment rearrangements 3 to the red / green color vision gene complex . The previous report of such rearrangements was based on small numbers and lack of knowledge that the frequency of "" abnormal "" color vision arrays on molecular analysis was twice as high as expected on the basis of the frequency of phenotypic color vision defects . The red / green color pigment ( R / GCP ) region was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis in 14 of these patients , and we did not find any fragment size difference between the patients and normal individuals who have the same number of pigment genes . The R / GCP region was also analyzed in 29 French and seven North American ALD patients by using six genomic DNA probes , isolated from a cosmid walk , that flank the color vision genes . No deletions were found with probes that lie 3 of the green pigment genes . One of the eight previously reported ALD individuals has a long deletion 5 of the red pigment gene , a deletion causing blue cone monochromacy . This finding and the previous findings of a 45 % frequency of phenotypic color vision defects in patients with AMN may suggest that the ALD / AMN gene lies 5 to the red pigment gene and that the frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe their origin to deleted DNA that includes regulatory genes for color vision . It is possible , however , that phenotypic color vision anomalies in AMN may be phenocopies secondary to retinal or neural involvement by the disease . The single case of blue cone monochromacy may therefore be a fortuitous coincidence of two diseases . .",0,0,1,0

"A phase I clinical study of the antipurine antifolate lometrexol (DDATHF) given with oral folic acid. Lometrexol is an antifolate which inhibits glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), an enzyme essential for de novo purine synthesis. Extensive experimental and limited clinical data have shown that lometrexol has activity against tumours which are refractory to other drugs, notably methotrexate. However, the initial clinical development of lometrexol was curtailed because of severe and cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical murine studies demonstrated that the toxicity of lometrexol can be prevented by low dose folic acid administration, i.e. for 7 days prior to and 7 days following a single bolus dose. This observation prompted a Phase I clinical study of lometrexol given with folic acid supplementation which has confirmed that the toxicity of lometrexol can be markedly reduced by folic acid supplementation. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the major toxicities. There was no clear relationship between clinical toxicity and the extent of plasma folate elevation. Associated studies demonstrated that lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics were not altered by folic acid administration indicating that supplementation is unlikely to reduce toxicity by enhancing lometrexol plasma clearance. The work described in this report has identified for the first time a clinically acceptable schedule for the administration of a GARFT inhibitor. This information will facilitate the future evaluation of this class of compounds in cancer therapy.",0,0,0,1
"Human complement factor H deficiency associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome.

"Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial block induced by propranolol. Alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sinoatrial (S-A) block was observed in a 57-year-old woman, under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol daily. The electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short P-P intervals and occasional pauses. These pauses were always preceded by the short P-P intervals and were usually followed by one or two P-P intervals of 0.92-0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycle. Following these basic sinus cycles, alternating rhythm started with the longer P-P interval. The long P-P intervals ranged between 1.04-1.12 s and the short P-P intervals between 0.80-0.84 s, respectively. The duration of the pauses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long P-P interval or to twice the basic sinus cycle. In one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2/1 S-A block was observed. This short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the P-P interval starting the alternative rhythm. There were small changes in the shape of the P waves and P-R intervals. S-A conduction through two pathways, the first with 2/1 block the second having 0.12-0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2/1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating P-P interval and other electrocardiographic features seen. Atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all P-P intervals without changing the rhythm. The abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was restarted a 2/1 S-A block was seen. This was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder.",1,0,0,0
"Mutation of MSH3 in endometrial cancer and evidence for its functional role in heteroduplex repair. Many human tumours have length alterations in repetitive sequence elements . Although this microsatellite instability has been attributed to mutations in four DNA mismatch repair genes in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) kindreds , many sporadic tumours exhibit instability but no detectable mutations in these genes . It is therefore of interest to identify other genes that contribute to this instability . In yeast , mutations in several genes , including RTH and MSH3 , cause microsatellite instability . Thus , we screened 16 endometrial carcinomas with microsatellite instability for alterations in FEN1 ( the human homolog of RTH ) and in MSH3 ( refs 12-14 ) . Although we found no FEN1 mutations , a frameshift mutation in MSH3 was observed in an endometrial carcinoma and in an endometrial carcinoma cell line . Extracts of the cell line were deficient in repair of DNA substrates containing mismatches or extra nucleotides . Introducing chromosome 5 , encoding the MSH3 gene , into the mutant cell line increased the stability of some but not all microsatellites . Extracts of these cells repaired certain substrates containing extra nucleotides , but were deficient in repair of those containing mismatches or other extra nucleotides . A subsequent search revealed a second gene mutation in HHUA cells , a missense mutation in the MSH6 gene . Together the data suggest that the MSH3 gene encodes a product that functions in repair of some but not all pre-mutational intermediates , its mutation in tumours can result in genomic instability and , as in yeast , MSH3 and MSH6 are partially redundant for mismatch repair . .",0,0,1,1

"Death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic disease. Multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high-risk stage of choriocarcinoma. Based on this principle a 27-year old woman, classified as being in the high-risk group (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), was treated with multiple cytotoxic drugs. The multiple drug schema consisted of: Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. On the first day of the schedule, moderate high doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide and Cyclophosphamide were administered. Within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, probably originating from the uterus. Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins, which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli. In view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, must be considered less likely. Patients with large pelvic tumor loads are, according to existing classifications, at high risk to die and to develop drug resistance. Notwithstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment, especially true for patients not previously exposed to this drug. Close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta-hCG values may indicate whether and when more agressive combination chemotherapy should be started.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,0,1

"Permeability, ultrastructural changes, and distribution of novel proteins in the glomerular barrier in early puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis. BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is still unclear what happens in the glomerulus when proteinuria starts. Using puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis (PAN) rats, we studied early ultrastructural and permeability changes in relation to the expression of the podocyte-associated molecules nephrin, a-actinin, dendrin, and plekhh2, the last two of which were only recently discovered in podocytes. METHODS: Using immune stainings, semiquantitative measurement was performed under the electron microscope. Permeability was assessed using isolated kidney perfusion with tracers. Possible effects of ACE inhibition were tested. RESULTS: By day 2, some patchy foot process effacement, but no proteinuria, appeared. The amount of nephrin was reduced in both diseased and normal areas. The other proteins showed few changes, which were limited to diseased areas. By day 4, foot process effacement was complete and proteinuria appeared in parallel with signs of size barrier damage. Nephrin decreased further, while dendrin and plekhh2 also decreased but a-actinin remained unchanged. ACE inhibition had no significant protective effect. CONCLUSIONS: PAN glomeruli already showed significant pathology by day 4, despite relatively mild proteinuria. This was preceded by altered nephrin expression, supporting its pivotal role in podocyte morphology. The novel proteins dendrin and plekhh2 were both reduced, suggesting roles in PAN, whereas a-actinin was unchanged.",0,1,1,0
"Ovarian cancer risk in BRCA1 carriers is modified by the HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) locus. Women who carry a mutation in the BRCA1 gene ( on chromosome 17q21 ) , have an 80 % risk of breast cancer and a 40 % risk of ovarian cancer by the age of 70 ( ref . 1 ) . The variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic factors play a role in tumourigenesis in these individuals . The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats ( VNTR ) polymorphism , located 1 kilobase ( kb ) downstream of the HRAS1 proto-oncogene ( chromosome 11p15 . 5 ) is one possible genetic modifier of cancer penetrance . Individuals who have rare alleles of the VNTR have an increased risk of certain types of cancers , including breast cancer ( 2-4 ) . To investigate whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer , we have typed a panel of 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based technique . The risk for ovarian cancer was 2 . 11 times greater for BRCA1 carriers harbouring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles , compared to carriers with only common alleles ( P = 0 . 015 ) . The magnitude of the relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele was not altered by adjusting for the other known risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer ( 5 ) .

During the past 10 years , we examined the G6PD activity in 21 , 271 newborn Chinese infants ( 11 , 400 males and 9 , 871 females ) and identified 314 ( 2 . 8 % ) males and 246 ( 2 . 5 % ) females having low G6PD activity . The G6PD gene from 10 randomly selected affected individuals and their relatives was polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) amplified , subcloned , and sequenced . Our results indicate that at least four types of mutation are responsible for the G6PD polymorphism in Taiwan . The first type of mutation ( 487 G----A ) was found in an affected Chinese with a G to A change at nucleotide 487 , which results in a ( 163 ) Gly to Ser substitution . The second type of mutation ( 493 A----G ) is a novel mutation that has not been reported in any other ethnic group and was identified in two affected Chinese . This mutation causes an A to G change at nucleotide position 493 , producing an ( 165 ) Asn to Asp substitution . Interestingly , the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations create Alu I and Ava II recognition sites , respectively , which enabled us to rapidly detect these two mutations by PCR / restriction enzyme ( RE ) digestion method . The third mutation ( 1376 G----T ) was found in four affected Chinese . This mutation causes a G to T change at nucleotide position 1376 that results in an ( 459 ) Arg to Leu substitution . The 1376 G----T mutation seems to be the dominant allele that causes G6PD deficiency in Taiwan . Finally , two affected Chinese were identified as having the fourth mutation ( 1388 G----A ) . This mutation causes a G to A change at nucleotide 1388 that produces an ( 463 ) Arg to His substitution . Our studies provide the direct proof of the genetic heterogeneity of G6PD deficiency in the Chinese populations of Taiwan and the PCR / RE digestion method is suitable for simultaneous detection of the 487 G----A and 493 A----G mutations .",0,0,1,0

"Ethopropazine and benztropine in neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. In a 12-week controlled study ethopropazine was compared to benztropine in the treatment of parkinsonism induced by fluphenazine enanthate in 60 schizophrenic outpatients. Ethopropazine and benztropine were found to be equally effective in controlling parkinsonian symptoms and were as efficacious as procyclidine, their previous antiparkinsonian drug. However, benztropine treated patients had a significant increase in tardive dyskinesia compared to their condition during procyclindine treatment, and significantly more anxiety and depression than ethopropazine treated patients. This suggests that benztropine is not the anticholinergic drug of choice in the treatment of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonian symptoms, because of its more toxic central and peripheral atropinic effect.",0,0,1,0

"Targeted disruption of ATM leads to growth retardation, chromosomal fragmentation during meiosis, immune defects, and thymic lymphoma. ATM , the gene mutated in the inherited human disease ataxia-telangiectasia , is a member of a family of kinases involved in DNA metabolism and cell-cycle checkpoint control . To help clarify the physiological roles of the ATM protein , we disrupted the ATM gene in mice through homologous recombination . Initial evaluation of the ATM knockout animals indicates that inactivation of the mouse ATM gene recreates much of the phenotype of ataxia-telangiectasia . The homozygous mutant ( ATM- / - ) mice are viable , growth-retarded , and infertile . The infertility of ATM- / - mice results from meiotic failure . Meiosis is arrested at the zygotene / pachytene stage of prophase I as a result of abnormal chromosomal synapsis and subsequent chromosome fragmentation . Immune defects also are evident in ATM- / - mice , including reduced numbers of B220 + CD43- pre-B cells , thymocytes , and peripheral T cells , as well as functional impairment of T-cell-dependent immune responses . The cerebella of ATM- / - mice appear normal by histologic examination at 3 to 4 months and the mice have no gross behavioral abnormalities . The majority of mutant mice rapidly develop thymic lymphomas and die before 4 months of age . These findings indicate that the ATM gene product plays an essential role in a diverse group of cellular processes , including meiosis , the normal growth of somatic tissues , immune development , and tumor suppression . .",0,0,1,1
"Familial male breast cancer is not linked to the BRCA1 locus on chromosome 17q. Breast cancer in men is about a hundredfold less common than in women and this has hindered research into its genetic basis . We have examined 22 families with at least one case of male breast cancer for linkage to the hereditary breast and ovarian cancer locus , BRCA1 , on chromosome 17q . We found strong evidence against linkage to BRCA1 ( lod score-16 . 63 ) and the best estimate of the proportion of linked families was 0 % ( 95 % CI 0-18 % ) . Our results indicate that there is a gene ( s ) other than BRCA1 which predisposes to early-onset breast cancer in women and which confers a higher risk of male breast cancer . Identification of additional pedigrees that include cases of male breast cancer may therefore facilitate the mapping and isolation of this gene .",0,0,0,1

"Analysis of meiotic segregation, using single-sperm typing: meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy locus. Meiotic drive at the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) locus has recently been suggested as being responsible for maintaining the frequency , in the human population , of DM chromosomes capable of expansion to the disease state . In order to test this hypothesis , we have studied samples of single sperm from three individuals heterozygous at the DM locus , each with one allele larger and one allele smaller than 19 CTG repeats . To guard against the possible problem of differential PCR amplification rates based on the lengths of the alleles , the sperm were also typed at another closely linked marker whose allele size was unrelated to the allele size at the DM locus . Using statistical models specifically designed to study single-sperm segregation data , we find no evidence of meiotic segregation distortion . The upper limit of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the estimate of the common segregation probability for the three donors is at or below . 515 for all models considered , and no statistically significant difference from . 5 is detected in any of the models . This suggests that any greater amount of segregation distortion at the myotonic dystrophy locus must result from events following sperm ejaculation .",0,0,1,0
"Testosterone-dependent hypertension and upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Blood pressure (BP) is more salt sensitive in men than in premenopausal women. In Dahl salt-sensitive rats (DS), high-salt (HS) diet increases BP more in males than females. In contrast to the systemic renin-angiotensin system, which is suppressed in response to HS in male DS, intrarenal angiotensinogen expression is increased, and intrarenal levels of ANG II are not suppressed. In this study, the hypothesis was tested that there is a sexual dimorphism in HS-induced upregulation of intrarenal angiotensinogen mediated by testosterone that also causes increases in BP and renal injury. On a low-salt (LS) diet, male DS had higher levels of intrarenal angiotensinogen mRNA than females. HS diet for 4 wk increased renal cortical angiotensinogen mRNA and protein only in male DS, which was prevented by castration. Ovariectomy of female DS had no effect on intrarenal angiotensinogen expression on either diet. Radiotelemetric BP was similar between males and castrated rats on LS diet. HS diet for 4 wk caused a progressive increase in BP, protein and albumin excretion, and glomerular sclerosis in male DS rats, which were attenuated by castration. Testosterone replacement in castrated DS rats increased BP, renal injury, and upregulation of renal angiotensinogen associated with HS diet. Testosterone contributes to the development of hypertension and renal injury in male DS rats on HS diet possibly through upregulation of the intrarenal renin-angiotensin system.",1,1,0,0
"Uncoupling of hypomyelination and glial cell death by a mutation in the proteolipid protein gene. Proteolipid protein ( PLP ; M ( r ) 30 , 000 ) is a highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein in myelin but its cellular function remains obscure . Neurological mutant mice can often provide model systems for human genetic disorders . Mutations of the X-chromosome-linked PLP gene are lethal , identified first in the jimpy mouse and subsequently in patients with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . The unexplained phenotype of these mutations includes degeneration and premature cell death of oligodendrocytes with associated hypomyelination . Here we show that a new mouse mutant rumpshaker is defined by the amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr at residue 186 in a membrane-embedded domain of PLP . Surprisingly , rumpshaker mice , although myelin-deficient , have normal longevity and a full complement of morphologically normal oligodendrocytes . Hypomyelination can thus be genetically separated from the PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration . We suggest that PLP has a vital function in glial cell development , distinct from its later role in myelin assembly , and that this dichotomy of action may explain the clinical spectrum of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease . .",0,0,1,0
"Damage of substantia nigra pars reticulata during pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the rat: immunohistochemical study of neurons, astrocytes and serum-protein extravasation. The substantia nigra has a gating function controlling the spread of epileptic seizure activity. Additionally, in models of prolonged status epilepticus the pars reticulata of substantia nigra (SNR) suffers from a massive lesion which may arise from a massive metabolic derangement and hyperexcitation developing in the activated SNR. In this study, status epilepticus was induced by systemic injection of pilocarpine in rats. The neuropathology of SNR was investigated using immunohistochemical techniques with the major emphasis on the time-course of changes in neurons and astrocytes. Animals surviving 20, 30, 40, 60 min, 2, 3, 6 hours, 1, 2, and 3 days after induction of status epilepticus were perfusion-fixed, and brains processed for immunohistochemical staining of SNR. Nissl-staining and antibodies against the neuron-specific calcium-binding protein, parvalbumin, served to detect neuronal damage in SNR. Antibodies against the astroglia-specific cytoskeletal protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and against the glial calcium-binding protein, S-100 protein, were used to assess the status of astrocytes. Immunohistochemical staining for serum-albumin and immunoglobulins in brain tissue was taken as indicator of blood-brain barrier disturbances and vasogenic edema formation. Immunohistochemical staining indicated loss of GFAP-staining already at 30 min after induction of seizures in an oval focus situated in the center of SNR while sparing medial and lateral aspects. At 1 h there was additional vacuolation in S-100 protein staining. By 2 hours, parvalbumin-staining changed in the central SNR indicating neuronal damage, and Nissl-staining visualized some neuronal distortion. Staining for serum-proteins occurred in a patchy manner throughout the forebrain during the first hours. By 6 h, vasogenic edema covered the lesioned SNR. By 24 h, glial and neuronal markers indicated a massive lesion in the center of SNR. By 48-72 h, astrocytes surrounding the lesion increased in size, and polymorphic phagocytotic cells invaded the damaged area. In a further group of animals surviving 1 to 5 days, conventional paraffin-sections confirmed the neuronal and glial damage of SNR. Additional pathology of similar quality was found in the globus pallidus. Since astrocytes were always damaged in parallel with neurons in SNR it is proposed that the anatomical and functional interrelationship between neurons and astrocytes is particularly tight in SNR. Both cell elements may suffer in common from metabolic disturbance and neurotransmitter dysfunction as occur during massive status epilepticus.",0,0,1,0
"Ketamine sedation for the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department. BACKGROUND: There recently has been a resurgence in the utilization of ketamine, a unique anesthetic, for emergency-department procedures requiring sedation. The purpose of the present study was to examine the safety and efficacy of ketamine for sedation in the treatment of children's fractures in the emergency department. METHODS: One hundred and fourteen children (average age, 5.3 years; range, twelve months to ten years and ten months) who underwent closed reduction of an isolated fracture or dislocation in the emergency department at a level-I trauma center were prospectively evaluated. Ketamine hydrochloride was administered intravenously (at a dose of two milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in ninety-nine of the patients and intramuscularly (at a dose of four milligrams per kilogram of body weight) in the other fifteen. A board-certified emergency physician skilled in airway management supervised administration of the anesthetic, and the patients were monitored by a registered nurse. Any pain during the reduction was rated by the orthopaedic surgeon treating the patient according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). RESULTS: The average time from intravenous administration of ketamine to manipulation of the fracture or dislocation was one minute and thirty-six seconds (range, twenty seconds to five minutes), and the average time from intramuscular administration to manipulation was four minutes and forty-two seconds (range, sixty seconds to fifteen minutes). The average score according to the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale was 6.4 points (range, 5 to 10 points), reflecting minimal or no pain during fracture reduction. Adequate fracture reduction was obtained in 111 of the children. Ninety-nine percent (sixty-eight) of the sixty-nine parents present during the reduction were pleased with the sedation and would allow it to be used again in a similar situation. Patency of the airway and independent respiration were maintained in all of the patients. Blood pressure and heart rate remained stable. Minor side effects included nausea (thirteen patients), emesis (eight of the thirteen patients with nausea), clumsiness (evident as ataxic movements in ten patients), and dysphoric reaction (one patient). No long-term sequelae were noted, and no patients had hallucinations or nightmares. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine reliably, safely, and quickly provided adequate sedation to effectively facilitate the reduction of children's fractures in the emergency department at our institution. Ketamine should only be used in an environment such as the emergency department, where proper one-on-one monitoring is used and board-certified physicians skilled in airway management are directly involved in the care of the patient.",1,0,1,0

"Identification of constitutional WT1 mutations, in patients with isolated diffuse mesangial sclerosis, and analysis of genotype/phenotype correlations by use of a computerized mutation database.

Most mutations in DDS patients lie in exon 8 or exon 9 , encoding zinc finger 2 or zinc finger 3 , respectively , with a hot spot ( R394W ) in exon 9 . We analyzed a series of 24 patients , 10 with isolated DMS ( IDMS ) , 10 with DDS , and 4 with urogenital abnormalities and / or WT .

"Biphasic response of the SA node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ketamine. Effect of ketamine on the SA node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the SA node artery. Injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the SA nodal activity by a direct action. This depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory phase. Bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine-induced tachycardia, while it was completely abolished in the reserpinized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta-blocking agent into the SA node artery. This may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the SA node artery.",1,0,0,0
"Adverse effects of the atypical antipsychotics. Collaborative Working Group on Clinical Trial Evaluations. Adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to noncompliance. Thus, clinicians should address patients' concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients' quality of life as well as overall health. The side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neuroleptics. Conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects, including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), tardive dyskinesia, sedation, and possible impairment of some cognitive measures, as well as cardiac effects, orthostatic hypotension, hepatic changes, anticholinergic side effects, sexual dysfunction, and weight gain. The newer atypical agents have a lower risk of EPS, but are associated in varying degrees with sedation, cardiovascular effects, anticholinergic effects, weight gain, sexual dysfunction, hepatic effects, lowered seizure threshold (primarily clozapine), and agranulocytosis (clozapine only). Since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atypicals, the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual's dissatisfaction and noncompliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient.",1,1,1,0

"Genetic heterogeneity in hereditary breast cancer: role of BRCA1 and BRCA2. The common hereditary forms of breast cancer have been largely attributed to the inheritance of mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes . However , it is not yet clear what proportion of hereditary breast cancer is explained by BRCA1 and BRCA2 or by some other unidentified susceptibility gene ( s ) . We describe the proportion of hereditary breast cancer explained by BRCA1 or BRCA2 in a sample of North American hereditary breast cancers and assess the evidence for additional susceptibility genes that may confer hereditary breast or ovarian cancer risk . Twenty-three families were identified through two high-risk breast cancer research programs . Genetic analysis was undertaken to establish linkage between the breast or ovarian cancer cases and markers on chromosomes 17q ( BRCA1 ) and 13q ( BRCA2 ) . Mutation analysis in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes was also undertaken in all families . The pattern of hereditary cancer in 14 ( 61 % ) of the 23 families studied was attributed to BRCA1 by a combination of linkage and mutation analyses . No families were attributed to BRCA2 . Five families ( 22 % ) provided evidence against linkage to both BRCA1 and BRCA2 . No BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations were detected in these five families . The BRCA1 or BRCA2 status of four families ( 17 % ) could not be determined . BRCA1 and BRCA2 probably explain the majority of hereditary breast cancer that exists in the North American population .

"A Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy with a codon 291 deletion: a clinical, biochemical, pathological, and genetic report. We report a Japanese family with adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) with a three base pair deletion ( delGAG 291 ) in the ALD gene . A variety of phenotypes were observed within this family . While the proband ( patient 1 ) was classified as having a rare intermediate type of adult cerebral and cerebello-brain stem forms , his younger brother ( patient 2 ) and nephew ( patient 3 ) had a childhood ALD type . Another nephew ( patient 4 ) of patient 1 was classified as having an adolescent form . The tau level in the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) in patient 1 was as high as that of patients with Alzheimers disease ( AD ) . His brain magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) showed abnormalities in the bilateral cerebellar hemispheres and brain stem , but not in the cerebral white matter , where marked reductions of the cerebral blood flow and oxygen metabolism were clearly demonstrated by positron emission tomography ( PET ) . In patients 2 and 3 , the autopsy findings showed massive demyelination of the cerebral white matter with sparing of the U-fibers , compatible with the findings of childhood ALD . Oleic and erucic acids ( Lorenzos Oil ) were administered to patients 1 and 4 , but sufficient effectiveness was not obtained . The findings in this family suggest that delGAG291 is part of the cause of Japanese ALD with phenotypic variations . Moreover , although the scale of the study is limited , there is a possibility that PET can detect an insidious lesion which is undetectable by computed tomogram ( CT ) or MRI analysis , and that the higher level of tau reflects the process of neuronal degeneration in ALD . Lorenzos Oil should be given in the early stage . .",0,0,1,0
"Characterization of a germline mosaicism in families with Lowe syndrome, and identification of seven novel mutations in the OCRL1 gene. The oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( OCRL ) is an X-linked disorder characterized by major abnormalities of eyes , nervous system , and kidneys . Mutations in the OCRL1 gene have been associated with the disease . OCRL1 encodes a phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-biphosphate ( PtdIns [ 4 , 5 ] P2 ) 5-phosphatase . We have examined the OCRL1 gene in eight unrelated patients with OCRL and have found seven new mutations and one recurrent in-frame deletion . Among the new mutations , two nonsense mutations ( R317X and E558X ) and three other frameshift mutations caused premature termination of the protein . A missense mutation , R483G , was located in the highly conserved PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 5-phosphatase domain . Finally , one frameshift mutation , 2799delC , modifies the C-terminal part of OCRL1 , with an extension of six amino acids . Altogether , 70 % of missense mutations are located in exon 15 , and 52 % of all mutations cluster in exons 11-15 . We also identified two new microsatellite markers for the OCRL1 locus , and we detected a germline mosaicism in one family .

"Curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phenobarbitone and carbamazepine administered rats. The antiepileptic drugs, phenobarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use. The increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin has shown antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective properties. Therefore, the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phenobarbitone- and carbamazepine-induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rats. Pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine were also studied. Vehicle/drugs were administered daily for 21days to male Wistar rats. Passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function. At the end of study period, serum phenobarbitone and carbamazepine, whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estimated. The administration of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine for 21days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress. Concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic drugs. Curcumin co-administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phenobarbitone as well as carbamazepine. These results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phenobarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentrations. The findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phenobarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs.",0,0,1,0

"Hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and/or glomerular hypertension. Despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level, relatively few methods have been available. In this study, we developed a new hypoxia-responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia-responsive element of the 5' vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia-sensing transgenic rat. We then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidney. With this model, we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney model. Expression of the hypoxia-responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period, reaching 2.2-fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin aminonucleoside model and 2.6-fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model, whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease, reflecting distinct behaviors of the two genes. The degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both models. Finally, we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen-positive, ED-1-positive, and terminal dUTP nick-end labeled-positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney model. We propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases.",1,1,0,0

Three yr after transplantation she developed renal Fanconi syndrome with severe metabolic acidosis, hypophosphatemia, glycosuria, and aminoaciduria. Although tacrolimus was suspected to be the cause of late post-transplant renal acidosis and was replaced by sirolimus, acidosis, and electrolyte imbalance got worse. Proximal muscle weakness has developed during her follow-up. Fanconi syndrome, as well as myopathy, is well recognized in patients with mitochondrial disorders and caused by depletion of mtDNA. We suggest that our patient's tubular dysfunction and myopathy may have resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction which is triggered by tacrolimus and augmented by lamivudine.",0,1,0,0
"Cardiac toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. Report of a case of spontaneous angina. We report a case of a patient with colon carcinoma and liver metastasis who presented chest pain after 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) administration. Clinical electrocardiographic evolution was similar to that observed in Prinzmetal's angina, and chest pain promptly resolved with nifedipine. These data suggest that coronary spasm may be the cause of cardiotoxicity due to 5-FU, and that calcium antagonists may probably be used in the prevention or treatment of 5-FU cardiotoxicity.",1,1,0,1

"Molecular analysis of the APC gene in 205 families: extended genotype-phenotype correlations in FAP and evidence for the role of APC amino acid changes in colorectal cancer predisposition. BACKGROUND / AIMS  The development of colorectal cancer and a variable range of extracolonic manifestations in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) is the result of the dominant inheritance of adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene mutations . In this study , direct mutation analysis of the APC gene was performed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations for nine extracolonic manifestations and to investigate the incidence of APC mutations in non-FAP colorectal cancer . METHODS  The APC gene was analysed in 190 unrelated FAP and 15 non-FAP colorectal cancer patients using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis , the protein truncation test , and direct sequencing . RESULTS  Chain terminating signals were only identified in patients belonging to the FAP group ( 105 patients ) . Amino acid changes were identified in four patients , three of whom belonged to the non-FAP group of colorectal cancer patients . Genotype-phenotype correlations identified significant differences in the nature of certain extracolonic manifestations in FAP patients belonging to three mutation subgroups . CONCLUSIONS  Extended genotype-phenotype correlations made in this study may have the potential to determine the most appropriate surveillance and prophylactic treatment regimens for those patients with mutations associated with life threatening conditions . This study also provided evidence for the pathological nature of amino acid changes in APC associated with both FAP and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients . .",0,0,1,1
"Resuscitation with lipid, epinephrine, or both in levobupivacaine-induced cardiac toxicity in newborn piglets. BACKGROUND: The optimal dosing regimens of lipid emulsion, epinephrine, or both are not yet determined in neonates in cases of local anaesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST). METHODS: Newborn piglets received levobupivacaine until cardiovascular collapse occurred. Standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation was started and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored for ventricular tachycardia, fibrillation, or QRS prolongation. Piglets were then randomly allocated to four groups: control (saline), Intralipid( ) alone, epinephrine alone, or a combination of Intralipd plus epinephrine. Resuscitation continued for 30 min or until there was a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) accompanied by a mean arterial pressure at or superior to the baseline pressure and normal sinus rhythm for a period of 30 min. RESULTS: ROSC was achieved in only one of the control piglets compared with most of the treated piglets. Mortality was not significantly different between the three treatment groups, but was significantly lower in all the treatment groups compared with control. The number of ECG abnormalities was zero in the Intralipid only group, but 14 and 17, respectively, in the epinephrine and epinephrine plus lipid groups (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsion with or without epinephrine, or epinephrine alone were equally effective in achieving a return to spontaneous circulation in this model of LAST. Epinephrine alone or in combination with lipid was associated with an increased number of ECG abnormalities compared with lipid emulsion alone.",1,0,0,0

"Delayed asystolic cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose; resuscitation with high dose intravenous calcium. A 51 year old man took a mixed overdose including 1.8-3.6 g of diltiazem, paracetamol, aspirin, isosorbide nitrate, and alcohol. He initially presented to hospital after six hours with mild hypotension and was treated with activated charcoal and intravenous fluids. Eighteen hours after the overdose he had two generalised tonic-clonic seizures. The patient remained unresponsive with junctional bradycardia, unrecordable blood pressure, and then became asystolic. He was resuscitated with high dose (13.5 g) intravenous calcium and adrenaline (epinephrine). He required inotropic support and temporary pacing over the next 48 hours. This case suggests there is a role for aggressive high dose intravenous calcium therapy in severe diltiazem overdose, particularly with the onset of asystole. It should be considered early in cases of cardiac arrest after diltiazem overdose. The case also highlights the problems with delayed toxicity when whole bowel irrigation is not administered.",1,1,1,0
"Tacrolimus-related seizure after pediatric liver transplantation--a single-center experience. To identify the risk factors for new-onset seizures after pediatric LT and to assess their clinical implications and long-term prognosis. The clinical and laboratory data of 27 consecutive children who underwent LT from January 2007 to December 2010 in our center were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into seizures group and a non-seizures group. Pre-operative, intra-operative, and post-operative data were collected. Seizures occurred in four children, an incidence of 14.8%. All exhibited generalized tonic-clonic seizures within the first two wk after LT. Univariate analysis showed that the risk factors associated with seizures after pediatric LT included gender, pediatric end-stage liver disease score before surgery, Child-Pugh score before surgery, serum total bilirubin after surgery, and trough TAC level. Multivariate analysis showed that trough TAC level was the only independent risk factor associated with the seizures. All children who experienced seizures survived with good graft function and remained seizure-free without anti-epileptic drugs over a mean follow-up period of 33.7 + 14.6 months. High trough TAC level was the predominant factor that contributed to seizures in the early post-operative period after pediatric LT. High PELD and Child-Pugh scores before LT and high post-operative serum Tbil may be contributory risk factors for TAC-related seizures.",0,1,1,0

"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) using calcineurin-based immunotherapy: risk of development and treatment. BACKGROUND: The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic. Their use in orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTX) has dramatically improved success rates. Recently, however, we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure (CRF) in OLTX patients. METHODS: Patients receiving an OLTX only from June 1985 through December of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied (n=834). Our prospectively collected database was the source of information. Patients were divided into three groups: Controls, no CRF or ESRD, n=748; CRF, sustained serum creatinine >2.5 mg/dl, n=41; and ESRD, n=45. Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables, diagnosis, postoperative variables, survival, type of ESRD therapy, and survival from onset of ESRD. RESULTS: At 13 years after OLTX, the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% (CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5%). Compared with control patients, CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels, a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome, higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively, and a higher 1-year serum creatinine. Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year, 3 months, and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively. Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups, but by year 13, the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group. Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who are more than 10 years post-OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate. The development of ESRD decreases survival, particularly in those patients treated with dialysis only. Patients who develop ESRD have a higher preoperative and 1-year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepatorenal syndrome. However, an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of CRF or ESRD. New strategies for long-term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication.",0,1,0,0
"Iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large French case-control study. F  d  ration Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer (FNCLCC). Since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer, its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examined. We have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case-control study. Cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer (n = 135) and 467 controls matched for age, year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were included. Women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk was higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment for more than 3 years (all p < 0.03) and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. Our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer, particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prognosis. Women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treatment. A long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted.",0,0,0,1
"""Real-world"" data on the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who were treated according to the standard clinical practice: a study of the Greek Myeloma Study Group. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) is a standard of care for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), but there is limited published data on its efficacy and safety in the ""real world"" (RW), according to the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research definition. We studied 212 RRMM patients who received RD in RW. Objective response (>PR (partial response)) rate was 77.4 % (complete response (CR), 20.2 %). Median time to first and best response was 2 and 5 months, respectively. Median time to CR when RD was given as 2nd or >2(nd)-line treatment at 4 and 11 months, respectively. Quality of response was independent of previous lines of therapies or previous exposure to thalidomide or bortezomib. Median duration of response was 34.4 months, and it was higher in patients who received RD until progression (not reached versus 19 months, p < 0.001). Improvement of humoral immunity occurred in 60 % of responders (p < 0.001) and in the majority of patients who achieved stable disease. Adverse events were reported in 68.9 % of patients (myelosuppression in 49.4 %) and 12.7 % of patients needed hospitalization. Peripheral neuropathy was observed only in 2.5 % of patients and deep vein thrombosis in 5.7 %. Dose reductions were needed in 31 % of patients and permanent discontinuation in 38.9 %. Median time to treatment discontinuation was 16.8 months. Performance status (PS) and initial lenalidomide dose predicted for treatment discontinuation. Extra-medullary relapses occurred in 3.8 % of patients. Our study confirms that RD is effective and safe in RRMM in the RW; it produces durable responses especially in patients who continue on treatment till progression and improves humoral immunity even in patients with stable disease.",0,0,1,0

"Management strategies for ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis C: clinical and economic implications. OBJECTIVES: Recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost-effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha-2b/ribavirin compared with interferon-alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect: ribavirin-induced hemolytic anemia (RIHA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health-care costs and management of RIHA during treatment of CHC in a clinical trial setting. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of RIHA. Decision-analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating RIHA. Uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: RIHA, defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g/L, occurs in approximately 7% to 9% of patients treated with combination therapy. The standard of care for management of RIHA is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dosage. We estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA to be  170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48-week treatment course (range  68- 692). The results of the one-way sensitivity analyses ranged from  57 to  317. In comparison, the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is  16,459. CONCLUSIONS: The direct cost of treating clinically significant RIHA is 1% ( 170/ 16,459) of drug treatment costs. Questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of RIHA in a real-world population. Despite these uncertainties, this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating RIHA provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect.",0,1,0,0
"Does supplemental vitamin C increase cardiovascular disease risk in women with diabetes?. BACKGROUND: Vitamin C acts as a potent antioxidant; however, it can also be a prooxidant and glycate protein under certain circumstances in vitro. These observations led us to hypothesize that a high intake of vitamin C in diabetic persons might promote atherosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to examine the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: We studied the relation between vitamin C intake and mortality from total cardiovascular disease (n = 281), coronary artery disease (n = 175), and stroke (n = 57) in 1923 postmenopausal women who reported being diabetic at baseline. Diet was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire at baseline, and subjects initially free of coronary artery disease were prospectively followed for 15 y. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, type of diabetes medication used, duration of diabetes, and intakes of folate, vitamin E, and beta-carotene, the adjusted relative risks of total cardiovascular disease mortality were 1.0, 0.97, 1.11, 1.47, and 1.84 (P for trend < 0.01) across quintiles of total vitamin C intake from food and supplements. Adjusted relative risks of coronary artery disease were 1.0, 0.81, 0.99, 1.26, and 1.91 (P for trend = 0.01) and of stroke were 1.0, 0.52, 1.23, 2.22, and 2.57 (P for trend < 0.01). When dietary and supplemental vitamin C were analyzed separately, only supplemental vitamin C showed a positive association with mortality endpoints. Vitamin C intake was unrelated to mortality from cardiovascular disease in the nondiabetic subjects at baseline. CONCLUSION: A high vitamin C intake from supplements is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in postmenopausal women with diabetes.",1,0,1,0
"Adverse effect of the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine on nephrosclerosis in rats with renovascular hypertension. The effect of a 6-week treatment with the calcium channel blocker nitrendipine or the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril on blood pressure, albuminuria, renal hemodynamics, and morphology of the nonclipped kidney was studied in rats with two-kidney, one clip renovascular hypertension. Six weeks after clipping of one renal artery, hypertensive rats (178 +/- 4 mm Hg) were randomly assigned to three groups: untreated hypertensive controls (n = 8), enalapril-treated (n = 8), or nitrendipine-treated (n = 10). Sham-operated rats served as normotensive controls (128 +/- 3 mm Hg, n = 8). After 6 weeks of treatment, renal hemodynamics (glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow) were measured in the anesthetized rats. Renal tissue was obtained for determination of glomerular size and sclerosis. Enalapril but not nitrendipine reduced blood pressure significantly. After 6 weeks of therapy, glomerular filtration rate was not different among the studied groups. Renal plasma flow increased, but albumin excretion and glomerulosclerosis did not change after enalapril treatment. In contrast, in the nitrendipine-treated group albuminuria increased from 12.8 +/- 2 progressively to 163 +/- 55 compared with 19.2 +/- 9 mg/24 hr in the hypertensive controls. Furthermore, glomerulosclerosis index was significantly increased in the nitrendipine-treated group compared with the hypertensive controls (0.38 +/- 0.1 versus 0.13 +/- 0.04). In addition, glomerular size was higher in the nitrendipine-treated group (14.9 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2) but lower in the enalapril-treated group (11.5 +/- 0.15 10(-3) mm2) compared with the hypertensive controls (12.1 +/- 0.17 10(-3) mm2).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,1,0,0
"Anti-oxidant effects of atorvastatin in dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat. 1. Dexamethasone (Dex)-induced hypertension is characterized by endothelial dysfunction associated with nitric oxide (NO) deficiency and increased superoxide (O2-) production. Atorvastatin (Ato) possesses pleiotropic properties that have been reported to improve endothelial function through increased availability of NO and reduced O2- production in various forms of hypertension. In the present study, we investigated whether 50 mg/kg per day, p.o., Ato could prevent endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) downregulation and the increase in O2- in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, thereby reducing blood pressure. 2. Male SD rats (n = 30) were treated with Ato (50 mg/kg per day in drinking water) or tap water for 15 days. Dexamethasone (10 microg/kg per day, s.c.) or saline was started after 4 days in Ato-treated and non-treated rats and continued for 11-13 days. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured on alternate days using the tail-cuff method. Endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine-induced vasorelaxation and phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction in aortic segments. Vascular eNOS mRNA was assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. 3. In rats treated with Dex alone, SBP was increased from 109 +/- 2 to 133 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 and Day 14, respectively (P < 0.001). In the Ato + Dex group, SBP was increased from 113 +/- 2 to 119 +/- 2 mmHg on Days 4 to 14, respectively (P < 0.001), but was significantly lower than SBP in the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.05). Endothelial-dependent relaxation and eNOS mRNA expression were greater in the Dex + Ato group than in the Dex only group (P < 0.05 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Aortic superoxide production was lower in the Dex + Ato group compared with the group treated with Dex alone (P < 0.0001). 4. Treatment with Ato improved endothelial function, reduced superoxide production and reduced SBP in Dex-treated SD rats.",1,0,1,0

"Severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas. BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is a malignant tumor that occurs in the cerebrum during adulthood. With current treatment regimens including combined surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the average life expectancy of the patients is limited to approximately 1 year. Therefore, patients with glioblastoma sometimes have intracarotid injection of carcinostatics added to the treatment regimen. Generally, carboplatin is said to have milder side effects than cisplatin, whose ocular and orbital toxicity are well known. However, we experienced a case of severe ocular and orbital toxicity after intracarotid injection of carboplatin, which is infrequently reported. CASE: A 58-year-old man received an intracarotid injection of carboplatin for recurrent glioblastomas in his left temporal lobe. He complained of pain and visual disturbance in the ipsilateral eye 30 h after the injection. Various ocular symptoms and findings caused by carboplatin toxicity were seen. RESULTS: He was treated with intravenous administration of corticosteroids and glycerin for 6 days after the injection. Although the intraocular pressure elevation caused by secondary acute angle-closure glaucoma decreased and ocular pain diminished, inexorable papilledema and exudative retinal detachment continued for 3 weeks. Finally, 6 weeks later, diffuse chorioretinal atrophy with optic atrophy occurred and the vision in his left eye was lost. CONCLUSION: When performing intracarotid injection of carboplatin, we must be aware of its potentially blinding ocular toxicity. It is recommended that further studies and investigations are undertaken in the effort to minimize such severe side effects.",0,0,1,1

Those drugs with strong affinity for 5-hydroxytryptamine1a receptors were able to reverse catalepsy. Drugs with affinity for other 5-HT receptors or weak affinity were ineffective. However, inhibition of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors neither inhibited nor potentiated reversal of catalepsy and leaves open the question as to the site or mechanism for this effect.",0,0,1,0
"Lithium-associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to divalproex sodium: a case series. BACKGROUND: Lithium remains a first-line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. Although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium, such as polyuria and tremor, more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments remain understudied. This report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to divalproex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impairments. METHOD: Open, case series design. RESULTS: We report seven cases where substitution of lithium, either fully or partially, with divalproex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive, motivational, or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patients. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary report, divalproex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits, loss of creativity, and functional impairments.",0,0,1,0
"Expression of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene in muscle and brain. Complementary DNA clones were isolated that represent the 5 terminal 2 . 5 kilobases of the murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( Dmd ) messenger RNA ( mRNA ) . Mouse Dmd mRNA was detectable in skeletal and cardiac muscle and at a level approximately 90 percent lower in brain . Dmd mRNA is also present , but at much lower than normal levels , in both the muscle and brain of three different strains of dystrophic mdx mice . The identification of Dmd mRNA in brain raises the possibility of a relation between human Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene expression and the mental retardation found in some DMD males . These results also provide evidence that the mdx mutations are allelic variants of mouse Dmd gene mutations .",0,0,1,0

"Changes in heart size during long-term timolol treatment after myocardial infarction. The effect of long-term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by X-ray in a double-blind study including 241 patients (placebo 126, timolol 115). The follow-up period was 12 months. The timolol-treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo group. These differences may be caused by timolol-induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end-diastolic volume. The timolol-related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart size. In patients with cardiomegaly, the increase in heart size was similar in both groups. After re-infarction, heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group.",1,0,0,0

"Nonsense mutation in exon 3 of the proteolipid protein gene (PLP) in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. We report a G-- > A transition at nucleotide 431 of the proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) results in a nonsense codon in a family with an unusual form of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) . The mutation , which creates a second AluI restriction site , results in a nonsense mutation in PLP . The clinical picture resembles somewhat that of X-linked spastic paraplegia ( SPG ) .

"Mechanism of increased iron absorption in murine model of hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression of the iron transporter DMT1 . Hereditary hemochromatosis ( HH ) is a common autosomal recessive disorder characterized by tissue iron deposition secondary to excessive dietary iron absorption . We recently reported that HFE , the protein defective in HH , was physically associated with the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) in duodenal crypt cells and proposed that mutations in HFE attenuate the uptake of transferrin-bound iron from plasma by duodenal crypt cells , leading to up-regulation of transporters for dietary iron . Here , we tested the hypothesis that HFE- / - mice have increased duodenal expression of the divalent metal transporter ( DMT1 ) . By 4 weeks of age , the HFE- / - mice demonstrated iron loading when compared with HFE + / + littermates , with elevated transferrin saturations ( 68 . 4 % vs . 49 . 8 % ) and elevated liver iron concentrations ( 985 micrograms vs . 381 micrograms ) . By using Northern blot analyses , we quantitated duodenal expression of both classes of DMT1 transcripts  one containing an iron responsive element ( IRE ) , called DMT1 ( IRE ) , and one containing no IRE , called DMT1 ( non-IRE ) . The positive control for DMT1 up-regulation was a murine model of dietary iron deficiency that demonstrated greatly increased levels of duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA . HFE- / - mice also demonstrated an increase in duodenal DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA ( average 7 . 7-fold ) , despite their elevated transferrin saturation and hepatic iron content . Duodenal expression of DMT1 ( non-IRE ) was not increased , nor was hepatic expression of DMT1 increased . These data support the model for HH in which HFE mutations lead to inappropriately low crypt cell iron , with resultant stabilization of DMT1 ( IRE ) mRNA , up-regulation of DMT1 , and increased absorption of dietary iron .",0,1,1,0

"Somatic von Hippel-Lindau mutation in clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis. Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis is an uncommon benign lesion that may occur sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease . Neither immunohistochemical studies nor molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene have been reported previously for this lesion . The authors describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis , both of which were initially confused with metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins ( Cam 5 . 2 and AE1 / AE3 ) , EMA , vimentin , alpha 1-antitrypsin , and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin . Each was negative for CEA . Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma is similar to renal cell carcinoma histologically , and because both occur as components of the von Hippel-Lindau disease complex , the authors analyzed both cases for the presence of mutations in the VHL gene . A somatic VHL gene mutation was detected in one of the two tumors by polymerase chain reaction followed by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis . Direct sequencing revealed a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide 694 , resulting in the replacement of an arginine with a stop codon after the sixth amino acid of exon 3 . As the VHL gene is believed to function as a tumor suppressor gene , VHL gene mutations may play a role in the initiation of tumorigenesis in sporadic cystadenomas of the epididymis .",0,1,0,1
"Invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis following cyclophosphamide therapy for nonmalignant disease. A 47-year-old woman with right hydroureteronephrosis due to ureterovesical junction obstruction had gross hematuria after being treated for five years wtih cyclophosphamide for cerebral vasculitis. A right nephroureterectomy was required for control of bleeding. The pathology specimen contained clinically occult invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Although the ability of cyclophosphamide to cause hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic abnormalities indistinguishable from high grade carcinoma is well known, it is less widely appreciated that it is also associated with carcinoma of the urinary tract. Twenty carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one carcinoma of the prostate have been reported in association with its use. The present case is the first carcinoma of the renal pelvis reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment. It is the third urinary tract cancer reported in association with cyclophosphamide treatment for nonmalignant disease. The association of the tumor with preexisting hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified exposure of upper urinary tract epithelium to cyclophosphamide.

"Linkage analysis of the apolipoprotein C2 gene and myotonic dystrophy on human chromosome 19 reveals linkage disequilibrium in a French-Canadian population. The gene for human apolipoprotein C2 ( APOC2 ) , situated on the proximal long arm of chromosome 19 , is closely linked to the gene for the most common form of adult muscular dystrophy , myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . Six APOC2 RFLPs ( TaqI , BglI , BanI , BamHI , NcoI , and AvaII ) have been identified to date . We have conducted a comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing all six RFLPs and involving 50 families and 372 individuals . The most informative RFLPs are , in descending order , NcoI ( lod = 6 . 64 , theta = 0 . 05 ) , BglI ( lod = 6 . 12 , theta = 0 . 05 ) , AvaII ( lod = 6 . 02 , theta = 0 . 03 ) , BanI ( lod = 5 . 76 , theta = 0 . 04 ) , TaqI ( lod = 4 . 29 , theta = 0 . 06 ) , and BamHI ( lod = 1 . 75 , theta = 0 . 01 ) . A substantial increase in the lod scores over those seen with the individual RFLPs was obtained when the linkage of the entire APOC2 haplotype ( composed of the six RFLPs ) was studied ( lod = 17 . 87 , theta = 0 . 04 ) . We have observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium . Consequently , the three most informative RFLPs have been found to be BanI , TaqI , and either BglI , AvaII , or NcoI polymorphisms . We also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium between DM and APOC2 in our French-Canadian population ( standardized disequilibrium constant phi = . 22 , chi 2 = 5 . 12 , df = 1 , P less than 0 . 04 ) . This represents the first evidence of linkage disequilibrium between APOC2 and the DM locus .",0,0,1,0
"Markedly accelerated catabolism of apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II) and high density lipoproteins containing ApoA-II in classic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency and fish-eye disease. Classic ( complete ) lecithin  cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) deficiency and Fish-eye disease ( partial LCAT deficiency ) are genetic syndromes associated with markedly decreased plasma levels of high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol but not with an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . We investigated the metabolism of the HDL apolipoproteins ( apo ) apoA-I and apoA-II in a total of five patients with LCAT deficiency , one with classic LCAT deficiency and four with Fish-eye disease . Plasma levels of apoA-II were decreased to a proportionately greater extent ( 23 % of normal ) than apoA-I ( 30 % of normal ) . In addition , plasma concentrations of HDL particles containing both apoA-I and apoA-II ( LpA-I  A-II ) were much lower ( 18 % of normal ) than those of particles containing only apoA-I ( LpA-I ) ( 51 % of normal ) . The metabolic basis for the low levels of apoA-II and LpA-I  A-II was investigated in all five patients using both exogenous radiotracer and endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques . The mean plasma residence time of apoA-I was decreased at 2 . 08 + / - 0 . 27 d ( controls 4 . 74 + / - 0 . 65 days ) ; however , the residence time of apoA-II was even shorter at 1 . 66 + / - 0 . 24 d ( controls 5 . 25 + / - 0 . 61 d ) . In addition , the catabolism of apoA-I in LpA-I  A-II was substantially faster than that of apoA-I in LpA-I . In summary , genetic syndromes of either complete or partial LCAT deficiency result in low levels of HDL through preferential hypercatabolism of apoA-II and HDL particles containing apoA-II . Because LpA-I has been proposed to be more protective than LpA-I  A-II against atherosclerosis , this selective effect on the metabolism of LpA-I  A-II may provide a potential explanation why patients with classic LCAT deficiency and Fish-eye disease are not at increased risk for premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels of HDL cholesterol and apoA-I",1,0,0,0

"von Willebrand disease type B: a missense mutation selectively abolishes ristocetin-induced von Willebrand factor binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib. von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) is a multimeric glycoprotein that mediates the adhesion of platelets to the subendothelium by binding to platelet glycoprotein Ib . For human vWF , this interaction can be induced in vitro by the antibiotic ristocetin or the snake venom protein botrocetin . A missense mutation , Gly-561-- > Ser , was identified within the proposed glycoprotein Ib binding domain of vWF in the proband with von Willebrand disease type B , a unique variant characterized by no ristocetin-induced , but normal botrocetin-induced , binding to glycoprotein Ib . The corresponding mutant recombinant protein , rvWF ( G561S ) , formed normal multimers and exhibited the same functional defect as the patients plasma vWF , confirming that this mutation causes von Willebrand disease type B . These data show that botrocetin and ristocetin cofactor activities of vWF can be dissociated by a point mutation and confirm that these mediators promote vWF binding to platelets by different mechanisms . The normal botrocetin-induced binding and the defective ristocetin-induced binding of rvWF ( G561S ) suggest that the primary defect in von Willebrand disease type B may be a failure of normal allosteric regulation of the glycoprotein Ib binding function of vWF . .",0,0,1,0

"Long-term glutamate supplementation failed to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of paclitaxel. Toxic peripheral neuropathy is still a significant limiting factor for chemotherapy with paclitaxel (PAC), although glutamate and its closely related amino acid glutamine were claimed to ameliorate PAC neurotoxicity. This pilot trial aimed to evaluate the role of glutamate supplementation for preventing PAC-induced peripheral neuropathy in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical and electro-diagnostic study. Forty-three ovarian cancer patients were available for analysis following six cycles of the same PAC-containing regimen: 23 had been supplemented by glutamate all along the treatment period, at a daily dose of three times 500 mg (group G), and 20 had received a placebo (group P). Patients were evaluated by neurological examinations, questionnaires and sensory-motor nerve conduction studies. There was no significant difference in the frequency of signs or symptoms between the two groups although neurotoxicity symptoms presented mostly with lower scores of severity in group G. However, this difference reached statistical significance only with regard to reported pain sensation (P = 0.011). Also the frequency of abnormal electro-diagnostic findings showed similarity between the two groups (G: 7/23 = 30.4%; P: 6/20 = 30%). This pilot study leads to the conclusion that glutamate supplementation at the chosen regimen fails to protect against peripheral neurotoxicity of PAC.",0,0,1,1

"Common BRCA1 variants and susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer in the general population. Most multiple case families of young onset breast cancer and ovarian cancer are thought to be due to highly penetrant mutations in the predisposing genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 . However , these mutations are uncommon in the population and they probably account for only a few percent of all breast cancer incidence . A much larger fraction of breast cancer might , in principle , be due to common variants which confer more modest individual risks . There are several common polymorphisms in the BRCA1 gene which generate amino acid substitutions . We have examined the frequency of four of these polymorphisms  Gln356Arg , Pro871Leu , Glu1038Gly and Ser1613Gly in large series of breast and ovarian cancer cases and matched controls . Due to strong linkage disequilibrium , these four sites generate only three haplotypes with a frequency > 1 . 3 % . The most common haplotypes , defined by the alleles Gln356Pro871Glu1038Ser1613 and Gln356Leu871Gly1038Gly1613 , have frequencies of 0 . 57 and 0 . 32 respectively , and these frequencies do not differ significantly between patient and control groups . Thus the most common polymorphisms of the BRCA1 gene do not make a significant contribution to breast or ovarian cancer risk . However , our data suggest that the Arg356 allele may have a different genotype distribution in breast cancer patients from that in controls ( Arg356 homozygotes are more frequent in the control groups , P = 0 . 01 ) , indicating that it may be protective against breast cancer . If this finding can be confirmed , it may provide an insight into the structural features of the BRCA1 protein that are important for its function .",0,0,1,1
"Oxidative stress on cardiotoxicity after treatment with single and multiple doses of doxorubicin. The mechanism of doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity remains controversial. Wistar rats (n = 66) received DOX injections intraperitoneally and were randomly assigned to 2 experimental protocols: (1) rats were killed before (-24 h, n = 8) and 24 h after (+24 h, n = 8) a single dose of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight) to determine the DOX acute effect and (2) rats (n = 58) received 4 injections of DOX (4 mg/kg body weight/week) and were killed before the first injection (M0) and 1 week after each injection (M1, M2, M3, and M4) to determine the chronological effects. Animals used at M0 (n = 8) were also used at moment -24 h of acute study. Cardiac total antioxidant performance (TAP), DNA damage, and morphology analyses were carried out at each time point. Single dose of DOX was associated with increased cardiac disarrangement, necrosis, and DNA damage (strand breaks (SBs) and oxidized pyrimidines) and decreased TAP. The chronological study showed an effect of a cumulative dose on body weight (R = -0.99, p = 0.011), necrosis (R = 1.00, p = 0.004), TAP (R = 0.95, p = 0.049), and DNA SBs (R = -0.95, p = 0.049). DNA SBs damage was negatively associated with TAP (R = -0.98, p = 0.018), and necrosis (R = -0.97, p = 0.027). Our results suggest that oxidative damage is associated with acute cardiotoxicity induced by a single dose of DOX only. Increased resistance to the oxidative stress is plausible for the multiple dose of DOX. Thus, different mechanisms may be involved in acute toxicity versus chronic toxicity.",1,0,1,0
"Further mapping of an ataxia-telangiectasia locus to the chromosome 11q23 region.

The present paper describes further mapping of the AT locus by means of a panel of 10 markers that span approximately 60 cM in the 11q22-23 region centered around S144 and THY1 . Location scores indicate that three contiguous subsegments within the [ S144-THY1 ] segment , as well as three contiguous segments telomeric to THY1 , are each unlikely to contain the AT locus , while the more centromeric [ STMY-S144 ] segment is most likely to contain the AT locus .

"Localization of the region homologous to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus on the mouse X chromosome. Recent progress has resulted in part of the gene mutated in Duchenne and the milder Becker muscular dystrophies being cloned and has suggested that the gene itself extends over 1 , 000 to 2 , 000 kilobases ( kb ) . To study how mutations in this gene affect muscle development and integrity , it would be of interest to have available a mouse model of the human disease . The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle and confers a mild dystrophic syndrome , but it is not clear whether this mutation is equivalent to Duchenne / Becker muscular dystrophy in man . Here we describe the use of two sequences from the human Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene that cross-hybridize to mouse X-linked sequences to localize the gene homologous to DMD in the mouse . Both sequences map to the region of 10 centimorgan lying between the Tabby ( Ta ) and St14-1 ( DxPas8 ) loci , close to the phosphorylase b kinase locus ( Phk ) . By analogy with the human X-chromosome , we conclude that the region in the mouse around the G6pd and St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding to distinct human myopathies  Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which is known to be closely linked to St14-1 in man and the DMD homologue described here . .",0,0,1,0

Maleate-induced renal injury included increase in renal vascular resistance and in the urinary excretion of total protein, glucose, sodium, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and N-acetyl b-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), upregulation of kidney injury molecule (KIM)-1, decrease in renal blood flow and claudin-2 expression besides of necrosis and apoptosis of tubular cells on 24 h. Oxidative stress was determined by measuring the oxidation of lipids and proteins and diminution in renal Nrf2 levels. Studies were also conducted in renal epithelial LLC-PK1 cells and in mitochondria isolated from kidneys of all the experimental groups. Maleate induced cell damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in LLC-PK1 cells in culture. In addition, maleate treatment reduced oxygen consumption in ADP-stimulated mitochondria and diminished respiratory control index when using malate/glutamate as substrate. The activities of both complex I and aconitase were also diminished. All the above-described alterations were prevented by curcumin. It is concluded that curcumin is able to attenuate in vivo maleate-induced nephropathy and in vitro cell damage. The in vivo protection was associated to the prevention of oxidative stress and preservation of mitochondrial oxygen consumption and activity of respiratory complex I, and the in vitro protection was associated to the prevention of ROS production.",0,1,0,0

"Effect of vincristine sulfate on Pseudomonas infections in monkeys. In rhesus monkeys, intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10(10) to 2.2 x 10(10)Pseudomonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days' duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challenge. Leukocytosis was observed in all monkeys. Intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 days. Intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10(10) to 7.8 x 10(10) pyocin type 6 Pseudomonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys, whereas none of four receiving Pseudomonas alone died.

"Effect of some anticancer drugs and combined chemotherapy on renal toxicity. The nephrotoxic action of anticancer drugs such as nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide (CY) administered alone or in combination [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)] was evaluated in experiments on Wistar rats. After drug administration, creatinine concentrations in the plasma and in the urine of the rats were determined, as well as creatinine clearance. Histopathologic evaluation of the kidneys was also performed. After MTX administration a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in the plasma creatinine concentration and a significant (p = 0.0001) decrease in creatinine clearance was noted compared to controls. After the administration of NG, 5-FU and CY neither a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration nor an increase in creatinine clearance was observed compared to the group receiving no cytostatics. Following polytherapy according to the CMF regimen, a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was found, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. CY caused hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, but it did not cause this complication when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histologic changes were found in rat kidneys after administration of MTX, CY and NG, while no such change was observed after 5-FU and joint administration of MTX + 5-FU + CY compared to controls. Our studies indicate that nephrotoxicity of MTX + 5-FU + CY administered jointly is lower than in monotherapy.",0,1,0,1

"Molecular basis of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency in three Israeli patients: identification of a complex mutant allele with P65L and K247Q mutations, the former being an exonic mutation causing exon 3 skipping. Very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( VLCAD ) deficiency is a life-threatening disorder of mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation . We identified four novel mutations in three unrelated patients . All patients had the severe childhood form of VLCAD deficiency with early onset and high mortality . Immunoblot analysis revealed that VLCAD protein was undetectable in patients 2 and 3 , whereas normal-size VLCAD protein and an aberrant form of VLCAD ( 4kDa smaller ) were detected in patient 1 . As expected , null mutations were found in patients 2 and 3  patient 2 is homozygous for a frameshift mutation , del 4 bp at 798-801 , and patient 3 is homozygous for a nonsense mutation 65C > A ( S22X ) . Patient 1 was homozygous for a complex mutant allele containing two alterations , including a 194C > T transition ( P65L ) and 739A > C transversion ( K247Q ) ; in the case of P65L , the amino acid change does not reduce enzyme activity . However , the nucleotide change resulted in exon 3 skipping , whereas the latter K247Q mutation had a drastic effect on enzyme activity . We verified these events by in vivo splicing experiments and transient expression analysis of mutant cDNAs . The P65L mutation locates 11 bases upstream of a splice donor site of intron 3 .

"Hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine in inflammatory arthritis: A case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse events. BACKGROUND: Spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are handicapped by under-reporting and limited detail on individual cases. We report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patients. METHODS: Serious ADR reports have been solicited from local clinicians by regular postcards over the past seven years. Patients', who had hepatotoxicity on sulfasalazine and met a definition of a serious ADR, were identified. Two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrument. The likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative assumptions. RESULTS: Ten cases were identified: eight occurred during surveillance. Eight patients were hospitalised, two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transplant. All but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treatment. Seven patients had a skin rash, three eosinophilia and one interstitial nephritis. Five patients were of Black British of African or Caribbean descent. Liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six. Drug-related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patients. The likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulfasalazine was estimated at 0.4% of treated patients. CONCLUSION: Serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulfasalazine appears to be under-appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important.",0,1,1,0

"5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine. Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies. We herein report the case of a 70-year-old man with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, in whom a high serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL) was observed. The patient, who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung, was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital; he had no cardiac history. After admission, the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU. As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, the administration of 5-FU was abandoned. Instead, oral administration of S-1 (a derivative of 5-FU), at 200 mg/day twice a week, was instituted, because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL. The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration. Thereafter, no cardiac symptoms were observed. The patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the S-1 treatment. The experience of this case, together with a review of the literature, suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity. S-1 may be administered safely to patients with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity.",1,1,1,1

"Severe early-onset obesity, adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation caused by POMC mutations in humans. Sequential cleavage of the precursor protein pre-pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) generates the melanocortin peptides adrenocorticotrophin ( ACTH ) , melanocyte-stimulating hormones ( MSH ) alpha , beta and gamma as well as the opioid-receptor ligand beta-endorphin . While a few cases of isolated ACTH deficiency have been reported ( OMIM 201400 ) , an inherited POMC defect has not been described so far . Recent studies in animal models elucidated a central role of alpha-MSH in the regulation of food intake by activation of the brain melanocortin-4-receptor ( MC4-R ; refs 3-5 ) and the linkage of human obesity to chromosome 2 in close proximity to the POMC locus , led to the proposal of an association of POMC with human obesity . The dual role of alpha-MSH in regulating food intake and influencing hair pigmentation predicts that the phenotype associated with a defect in POMC function would include obesity , alteration in pigmentation and ACTH deficiency . The observation of these symptoms in two probands prompted us to search for mutations within their POMC genes . Patient 1 was found to be a compound heterozygote for two mutations in exon 3 ( G7013T , C7133delta ) which interfere with appropriate synthesis of ACTH and alpha-MSH . Patient 2 was homozygous for a mutation in exon 2 ( C3804A ) which abolishes POMC translation . These findings represent the first examples of a genetic defect within the POMC gene and define a new monogenic endocrine disorder resulting in early-onset obesity , adrenal insufficiency and red hair pigmentation . .",0,1,1,0
"D-penicillamine in the treatment of localized scleroderma. Localized scleroderma has no recognized internal organ involvement but may be disfiguring and disabling when the cutaneous lesions are extensive or affect children. There is no accepted or proven treatment for localized scleroderma. Case reports of 11 patients with severe, extensive localized scleroderma who were treated with D-penicillamine are summarized in this article. This drug was judged to have a favorable effect on the disease course in 7 (64%) of 11 patients. Improvement began within 3 to 6 months and consisted of cessation of active cutaneous lesions in all 7 patients, skin softening in 5, and more normal growth of the affected limb in 2 of 3 children. Joint stiffness and contractures also improved. The dose of D-penicillamine associated with a favorable response was as low as 2 to 5 mg/kg per day given over a period ranging from 15 to 53 months. D-Penicillamine caused nephrotic syndrome in 1 patient and milder reversible proteinuria in 3 other patients; none developed renal insufficiency. These data suggest that D-penicillamine may be effective in severe cases of localized scleroderma.",0,1,0,0

"Oral contraceptives and the risk of hereditary ovarian cancer. Hereditary Ovarian Cancer Clinical Study Group. BACKGROUND  Women with mutations in either the BRCA1 or the BRCA2 gene have a high lifetime risk of ovarian cancer . Oral contraceptives protect against ovarian cancer in general , but it is not known whether they also protect against hereditary forms of ovarian cancer . METHODS  We enrolled 207 women with hereditary ovarian cancer and 161 of their sisters as controls in a case-control study . All the patients carried a pathogenic mutation in either BRCA1 ( 179 women ) or BRCA2 ( 28 women ) . The control women were enrolled regardless of whether or not they had either mutation . Lifetime histories of oral-contraceptive use were obtained by interview or by written questionnaire and were compared between patients and control women , after adjustment for year of birth and parity . RESULTS  The adjusted odds ratio for ovarian cancer associated with any past use of oral contraceptives was 0 . 5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 8 ) . The risk decreased with increasing duration of use ( P for trend , ovarian cancer both for carriers of the BRCA1 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 5 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 3 to 0 . 9 ) and for carriers of the BRCA2 mutation ( odds ratio , 0 . 4 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0 . 2 to 1 . 1 ) .

"A prospective study on the dose dependency of cardiotoxicity induced by mitomycin C. Since 1975 mitomycin C (MMC) has been suggested to be cardiotoxic, especially when combined with or given following doxorubicin. Data on dose dependency or incidence concerning this side effect were not known. We have initiated a prospective study to obtain some more data on these subjects. Forty-four MMC-treated patients were studied, 37 of them could be evaluated. All patients were studied by repeated physical examinations, chest X-rays, electro- and echocardiography and radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) determinations. The results were evaluated per cumulative dose level. One of the patients developed cardiac failure after 30 mg m-2 MMC and only 150 mg m-2 doxorubicin. The cardiac failure was predicted by a drop in EF determined during a cold pressor test. None of the other patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity, nor did the studied parameters change. The literature on this subject was also reviewed. Based on the combined data from the present study and the literature, we suggest that MMC-related cardiotoxicity is dose dependent, occurring at cumulative dose levels of 30 mg m-2 or more, mainly in patients also (previously or simultaneously) treated with doxorubicin. The incidence is likely to be less than 10% even for this risk group.",1,0,0,0

"Antioxidant effects of bovine lactoferrin on dexamethasone-induced hypertension in rat. Dexamethasone- (Dex-) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress. Lactoferrin (LF) is an iron-binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic administration of LF on oxidative stress and hypertension upon Dex administration. Male Wistar rats were treated by Dex (30  u g/kg/day subcutaneously) or saline for 14 days. Oral bovine LF (30, 100, 300 mg/kg) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal study. In a prevention study, rats received 4 days of LF treatment followed by Dex and continued during the test period. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured using tail-cuff method. Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity. Plasma hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) value were determined. Dexamethasone significantly increased SBP and plasma H2O2 level and decreased thymus and body weights. LF lowered (P < 0.01) and dose dependently prevented (P < 0.001) Dex-induced hypertension. LF prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma H2O2 and increased FRAP values. Chronic administration of LF strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ROS and improved antioxidant capacity in Dex-induced hypertension, suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of LF.",1,0,0,0

"Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients. BACKGROUND: Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection, and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-based regimens. To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus. We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use. In each patient, the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria. METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999-2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen. In these patients, the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein:creatinine ratios, an estimate of grams of proteinuria/day. Laboratory results were compared between prior, during and following sirolimus use. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients (24%) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post-transplantation course. In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive. In 7 of the 28 patients there was a striking temporal association between the initiation of sirolimus and the development of nephrotic-range proteinuria. Proteinuria correlated most strongly with sirolimus therapy when compared to other demographic and clinical variables. In most patients, discontinuation of sirolimus resulted in a decrease, but not resolution, of proteinuria. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus induces or aggravates pre-existing proteinuria in an unpredictable subset of renal allograft recipients. Proteinuria may improve, but does not resolve, when sirolimus is withdrawn.",0,1,1,0
"Protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin aminonucleoside nephrosis in rats. We investigated the effects of antithrombin, a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors, in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrosis, which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syndrome. Antithrombin (50 or 500 IU/kg/i.v.) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (50 mg/kg/i.v.). Treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin aminonucleoside-induced hematological abnormalities. Puromycin aminonucleoside-induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also suppressed. Histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as proteinaceous casts in tubuli and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats, while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin-treated rats. In addition, antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin aminonucleoside-induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cells. Furthermore, puromycin aminonucleoside-induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decreased. These findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. Treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome.",0,1,0,0

"Acute renal insufficiency after high-dose melphalan in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis during stem cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) have a poor prognosis. Median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 months. High-dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) appears to be the most promising therapy, but treatment mortality can be high. The authors have noted the development of acute renal insufficiency immediately after melphalan conditioning. This study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortality. METHODS: Consecutive AL patients who underwent PBSCT were studied retrospectively. Acute renal insufficiency (ARI) after high-dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50% of baseline immediately after conditioning. Urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscopy. RESULTS: Of the 80 patients studied, ARI developed in 18.8% of the patients after high-dose melphalan. Univariate analysis identified age, hypoalbuminemia, heavy proteinuria, diuretic use, and urine sediment score (>3) as risk factors. Age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analysis. Patients who had ARI after high-dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often (P = 0.007), and had a worse 1-year survival (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: The timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative agent. Ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sediment. Development of ARI adversely affected the outcome after PBSCT. Effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of PBSCT in AL patients.",0,1,0,0

"GABA involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental. No agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by CNS depressants, such as general anesthetics. In this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats. 25 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate, increased GABA, decreased glutamate, and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem. Pretreatment of rats with thiosemicarbazide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental. 50 mg/kg, i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in GABA and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat brain. Naloxone (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reversed respiratory paralysis, glutamate and GABA levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebellum. These data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves GABA in its action.",0,0,1,0
"Trinucleotide repeat expansion at the myotonic dystrophy locus reduces expression of DMAHP. Myotonic dystrophy , or dystrophia myotonica ( DM ) , is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder caused by the expansion of a CTG trinucleotide repeat in the 3 untranslated region of the DMPK protein kinase gene on chromosome 19q13 . 3 ( refs 1-3 ) . Although the DM mutation was identified more than five years ago , the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this most prevalent form of hereditary adult neuromuscular disease remain elusive . Previous work from our laboratory demonstrated that a DNase l-hypersensitive site located adjacent to the repeats on the wild-type allele is eliminated by repeat expansion , indicating that large CTG-repeat arrays may be associated with a local chromatin environment that represses gene expression . Here we report that the hypersensitive site contains an enhancer element that regulates transcription of the adjacent DMAHP homeobox gene . Analysis of DMAHP expression in the cells of DM patients with loss of the hypersensitive site revealed a two- to fourfold reduction in steady-state DMAHP transcript levels relative to wild-type controls . Allele-specific analysis of DMAHP expression showed that steady-state transcript levels from the expanded allele were greatly reduced in comparison to those from the wild-type allele . Together , these results demonstrate that CTG-repeat expansions can suppress local gene expression and implicate DMAHP in DM pathogenesis .",0,0,1,0

"Early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcinoma. A multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Adriamycin (50 mg/50 ml) was administered intravesically within 24 h after transurethral resection of TA-T1 (O-A) bladder tumors. Instillation was repeated twice during the first week, then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year. The tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients, and 29 patients presented with local side-effects. In 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the study. No systemic side-effects were observed. Recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow-up and in 72 patients followed for 2-3 years (mean 32 months). Of the 82 patients studied after 1 year, 23 had primary and 59 recurrent disease. Of the 82 evaluable patients, 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year (61%), while 32 presented with one or more recurrences (39%). Of these recurrences, 27 were T1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive lesions. In patients that were free of recurrence during the first year, 80% remained tumor-free during the 2- to 3-year follow-up period. Of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year, only 50% presented with further recurrence once the instillations were stopped. The beneficial effect of Adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself, the early and repeated instillations after TUR, or both.",0,0,0,1

"On the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rats. The development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rats. Saline-pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine (20 mg/kg i.p.) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromyogram. Rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36-40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance: about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were akinetic (A group). The other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped (S) licking and/or gnawing in presence of akinetic or hyperkinetic (K) behaviour (AS/KS group), suggesting signs of dopaminergic activation. The rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days' treatment. In a further series of experiments, haloperidol (0.2 mg/kg i.p.) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic interference. Haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the A group. However, the level in the AS/KS group remained considerably lower than in the A group. The results suggest that rigidity, which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum, can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the striatum. Nevertheless, there occurs some real tolerance to this effect. The rapid alternations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the AS/KS group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various DA-innervated structures.",0,0,1,0

"Comparison of effects of isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem in prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy. INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) significantly increases the morbidity and mortality of patients. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the protective effects of isotonic sodium chloride with sodium bicarbonate infusion and isotonic sodium chloride infusion with diltiazem, a calcium channel blocker, in preventing CIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included patients who were administered 30-60 mL of iodinated contrast agent for percutaneous coronary angiography (PCAG), all with creatinine values between 1.1 and 3.1 mg/dL. Patients were divided into three groups and each group had 20 patients. The first group of patients was administered isotonic sodium chloride; the second group was administered a solution that of 5% dextrose and sodium bicarbonate, while the third group was administered isotonic sodium chloride before and after the contrast injection. The third group received an additional injection of diltiazem the day before and first 2 days after the contrast injection. All of the patients' plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels were measured on the second and seventh day after the administration of intravenous contrast material. RESULTS: The basal creatinine levels were similar for all three groups (p > 0.05). Among a total of 60 patients included in the study, 16 patients developed acute renal failure (ARF) on the second day after contrast material was injected (26.6%). The number of patients who developed ARF on the second day after the injection in the first group was five (25%), in the second group was six (30%) and the third group was five (25%) (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference between isotonic sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate and isotonic sodium chloride with diltiazem application in prevention of CIN.",1,1,0,0
"Atm and Bax cooperate in ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system. Ataxia-telangiectasia is a hereditary multisystemic disease resulting from mutations of ataxia telangiectasia , mutated ( ATM ) and is characterized by neurodegeneration , cancer , immune defects , and hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation . The molecular details of ATM function in the nervous system are unclear , although the neurological lesion in ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early in life , suggesting a developmental origin . The central nervous system ( CNS ) of Atm-null mice shows a pronounced defect in apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress , suggesting ATM functions to eliminate neurons with excessive genomic damage . Here , we report that the death effector Bax is required for a large proportion of Atm-dependent apoptosis in the developing CNS after ionizing radiation ( IR ) . Although many of the same regions of the CNS in both Bax- / - and Atm- / - mice were radioresistant , mice nullizygous for both Bax and Atm showed additional reduction in IR-induced apoptosis in the CNS . Therefore , although the major IR-induced apoptotic pathway in the CNS requires Atm and Bax , a p53-dependent collateral pathway exists that has both Atm- and Bax-independent branches . Further , Atm- and Bax-dependent apoptosis in the CNS also required caspase-3 activation . These data implicate Bax and caspase-3 as death effectors in neurodegenerative pathways . .",0,0,1,1
"Myocardial infarction in pregnancy associated with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction: a case report. BACKGROUND: Clomiphene citrate (CC) is commonly prescribed for ovulation induction. It is considered safe, with minimal side effects. Thromboembolism is a rare but life-threatening complication that has been reported after ovulation induction with CC. Spontaneous coronary thrombosis or thromboembolism with subsequent clot lysis has been suggested as one of the most common causes of myocardial infarction (MI) during pregnancy, with a subsequently normal coronary angiogram. CASE: A 33-year-old woman with a 5-week gestation had recently received CC for ovulation induction and presented with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed a lateral and anterior wall myocardial infarction. Cardiac enzymes showed a peak rise in troponin I to 9.10 ng/mL. An initial exercise stress test was normal. At the time of admission, the patient was at high risk of radiation injury to the fetus, so a coronary angiogram was postponed until the second trimester. It showed normal coronary vessels. CONCLUSION: This appears to be the first reported case documenting a possible association between CC and myocardial infarction. Thrombosis might be a rare but hazardous complication of CC. Given this life-threatening complication, appropriate prophylactic measures should be used in high-risk woman undergoing ovarian stimulation.",1,0,0,0
Theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rats. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregnancy. Sprague-Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively. Theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum (total) and CSF were similar but serum (free) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats. Theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats. Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former. It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats.,0,0,1,0

"National project on the prevention of mother-to-infant infection by hepatitis B virus in Japan.

These infants are treated with two injections of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and at least three injections of plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine. We sent questionnaires about the numbers of each procedure or examination during nine months of investigation period to each local government in 1986 and 1987. 93.4% pregnant women had the chance to be examined for HBsAg, and the positive rate was 1.4 to 1.5%. The HBeAg positive rate in HBsAg positive was 23 to 26%. The HBsAg positive rate in neonates and in infants before two months were 3% and 2% respectively.

"Expression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from apoptosis in vivo. Doxorubicin is an anti-tumor agent that represses cardiac-specific gene expression and induces myocardial cell apoptosis. Doxorubicin depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator that is required for the maintenance of the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. However, the role of p300 in protection against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis is unknown. Transgenic mice overexpressing p300 in the heart and wild-type mice were subjected to doxorubicin treatment. Compared with wild-type mice, transgenic mice exhibited higher survival rate as well as more preserved left ventricular function and cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. Doxorubicin induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in transgenic mice. Expression of p300 increased the cardiac level of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not that of p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. These findings demonstrate that overexpression of p300 protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.",1,0,0,1
"Coincidence of two novel arylsulfatase A alleles and mutation 459+1G>A within a family with metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity. In a family with three siblings , one developed classical late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) , fatal at age 5 years , with deficient arylsulfatase A ( ARSA ) activity and increased galactosylsulfatide ( GS ) excretion . The two other siblings , apparently healthy at 12 ( 1 / 2 ) and 15 years , respectively , and their father , apparently healthy as well , presented ARSA and GS values within the range of MLD patients . Mutation screening and sequence analysis disclosed the involvement of three different ARSA mutations being the molecular basis of intrafamilial phenotypic heterogeneity . The late infantile patient inherited from his mother the frequent 0-type mutation 459 + 1G > A , and from his father a novel , single basepair microdeletion of guanine at nucleotide 7 in exon 1 ( 7delG ) . The two clinically unaffected siblings carried the maternal mutation 459 + 1G > A and , on their paternal allele , a novel cytosine to thymidine transition at nucleotide 2435 in exon 8 , resulting in substitution of alanine 464 by valine ( A464V ) . The fathers genotype thus was 7delG / A464V . Mutation A464V was not found in 18 unrelated MLD patients and 50 controls . A464V , although clearly modifying ARSA and GS levels , apparently bears little significance for clinical manifestation of MLD , mimicking the frequent ARSA pseudodeficiency allele . Our results demonstrate that in certain genetic conditions MLD-like ARSA and GS values need not be paralleled by clinical disease , a finding with serious diagnostic and prognostic implications . Moreover , further ARSA alleles functionally similar to A464V might exist which , together with 0-type mutations , may cause pathological ARSA and GS levels , but not clinical outbreak of the disease . .",0,0,1,0
"Sirolimus-associated proteinuria and renal dysfunction. Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor-containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase. Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy. Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis, autoimmunity, cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation. Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors, it has been designated a 'non-nephrotoxic drug'. However, clinical reports suggest that, under some circumstances, sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction. A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre-existing chronic renal damage. The mechanisms of sirolimus-associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal. It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability/injury, but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive. The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus (such as in delayed graft function) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival/repair processes. Although these adverse effects occur in some patients, their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney, the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations, close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed. Further long-term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future.",0,1,1,1

"The effect of recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-I on chronic puromycin aminonucleoside nephropathy in rats. We recently demonstrated that recombinant hGH exacerbates renal functional and structural injury in chronic puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephropathy, an experimental model of glomerular disease. Therefore, we examined whether recombinant human (rh) IGF-I is a safer alternative for the treatment of growth failure in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. The glomerulopathy was induced by seven serial injections of PAN over 12 wk. Experimental animals (n = 6) received rhIGF-I, 400 micrograms/d, whereas control rats (n = 6) received the vehicle. rhIGF-I improved weight gain by 14% (p < 0.05), without altering hematocrit or blood pressure in rats with renal disease. Urinary protein excretion was unaltered by rhIGF-I treatment in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy. After 12 wk, the inulin clearance was higher in rhIGF-I-treated rats, 0.48 +/- 0.08 versus 0.24 +/- 0.06 mL/min/100 g of body weight in untreated PAN nephropathy animals, p < 0.05. The improvement in GFR was not associated with enhanced glomerular hypertrophy or increased segmental glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury, or renal cortical malondialdehyde content. In rats with PAN nephropathy, administration of rhIGF-I increased IGF-I and GH receptor gene expression, without altering the steady state level of IGF-I receptor mRNA. In normal rats with intact kidneys, rhIGF-I administration (n = 4) did not alter weight gain, blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, glomerular planar area, renal cortical malondialdehyde content, or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage, compared with untreated animals (n = 4). rhIGF-I treatment reduced the steady state renal IGF-I mRNA level but did not modify gene expression of the IGF-I or GH receptors. We conclude that: 1) administration of rhIGF-I improves growth and GFR in rats with chronic PAN nephropathy and 2) unlike rhGH, long-term use of rhIGF-I does not worsen renal functional and structural injury in this disease model.",1,1,1,0

"Mice lacking mPGES-1 are resistant to lithium-induced polyuria. Cyclooxygenase-2 activity is required for the development of lithium-induced polyuria. However, the involvement of a specific, terminal prostaglandin (PG) isomerase has not been evaluated. The present study was undertaken to assess lithium-induced polyuria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). A 2-wk administration of LiCl (4 mmol.kg(-1).day(-1) ip) in mPGES-1 +/+ mice led to a marked polyuria with hyposmotic urine. This was associated with elevated renal mPGES-1 protein expression and increased urine PGE(2) excretion. In contrast, mPGES-1 -/- mice were largely resistant to lithium-induced polyuria and a urine concentrating defect, accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine PGE(2) and cAMP output. Immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and quantitative (q) RT-PCR consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin-2 (AQP2) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium-treated +/+ mice. This decrease was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. qRT-PCR detected similar patterns of changes in AQP2 mRNA in the medulla but not in the cortex. Similarly, the total protein abundance of the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the +/+ mice was significantly reduced by lithium treatment. In contrast, the dowregulation of renal medullary NKCC2 expression was significantly attenuated in the -/- mice. We conclude that mPGES-1-derived PGE(2) mediates lithium-induced polyuria likely via inhibition of AQP2 and NKCC2 expression.",0,1,0,0
"Deficiency of the fifth component of complement in human subjects. Clinical, genetic and immunologic studies in a large kindred. The discovery of a large kindred with a heritable deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) has permitted the accumulation of new clinical , genetic and immunologic data concerning the role of C5 in human subjects . The proband , who has had nine episodes of disseminated gonococcal infection , has a hemolytic C5 level of approximately 0 . 5 per cent of normal . No C5 protein was detectable , but low levels of functional C5 activity could be found using a sensitive bactericidal assay . The probands twin as well as another sister also had extremely low levels of hemolytic C5 ( approximately 0 . 5 per cent normal ) , but both these subjects have been healthy . Hemolytic complement and bacteriolytic activity could be restored by the addition of purified C5 . No chemotactic activity for polymorphonuclear leukocytes could be generated in the C5-deficient serums upon activation of either the classic or alternative pathways , again demonstrating the importance of C5 in human subjects for the production of chemotactic factors .

"Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced hyperactivity in rats. Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation. In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined. In addition, the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine. Locomotor activity was assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats tested in photocell cages. Nicotine (1.0 mg/kg) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were habituated to the test environment, but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environment. The stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexamethonium, indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic receptors. Nicotine-induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective D1 antagonist SCH 23390, the selective D2 antagonist raclopride and the D1/D2 antagonist fluphenazine. Pretreatment with the D2 agonist PHNO enhanced nicotine-induced hyperactivity, whereas the D1 agonist SKF 38393 had no effect. The results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats habituated to the test environment. The effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors, possibly located on dopaminergic neurons, and also requires the activation of both D1 and D2 dopamine receptors.",0,0,1,0
"Dexmedetomidine, acting through central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, prevents opiate-induced muscle rigidity in the rat. The highly-selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist dexmedetomidine (D-MED) is capable of inducing muscle flaccidity and anesthesia in rats and dogs. Intense generalized muscle rigidity is an undesirable side effect of potent opiate agonists. Although the neurochemistry of opiate-induced rigidity has yet to be fully elucidated, recent work suggests a role for a central adrenergic mechanism. In the present study, the authors determined if treatment with D-MED prevents the muscle rigidity caused by high-dose alfentanil anesthesia in the rat. Animals (n = 42) were treated intraperitoneally with one of the following six regimens: 1) L-MED (the inactive L-isomer of medetomidine), 30 micrograms/kg; 2) D-MED, 10 micrograms/kg; 3) D-MED, 30 micrograms/kg; 4) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the central-acting alpha-2 antagonist, idazoxan [10 mg/kg]; 5) D-MED [30 micrograms/kg] and the peripheral-acting alpha-2 antagonist DG-5128 [10 mg/kg], or; 6) saline. Baseline electromyographic activity was recorded from the gastrocnemius muscle before and after drug treatment. Each rat was then injected with alfentanil (ALF, 0.5 mg/kg sc). ALF injection resulted in a marked increase in hindlimb EMG activity in the L-MED treatment group which was indistinguishable from that seen in animals treated with saline. In contrast, D-MED prevented alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity in a dose-dependent fashion. The small EMG values obtained in the high-dose D-MED group were comparable with those recorded in earlier studies from control animals not given any opiate. The high-dose D-MED animals were flaccid, akinetic, and lacked a startle response during the entire experimental period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,1,0
"The role of nicotine in smoking-related cardiovascular disease. Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease. Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis, but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect. Almost certainly, nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events, although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide. Nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among humans. Clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular events. Finally, the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat, suggesting that if nicotine is involved, adverse effects might be seen with relatively low-level cigarette exposures.",1,0,0,0

"A mouse model for Prader-Willi syndrome imprinting-centre mutations. Imprinting in the 15q11-q13 region involves an imprinting centre ( IC ) , mapping in part to the promoter and first exon of SNRPN . Deletion of this IC abolishes local paternally derived gene expression and results in Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) . We have created two deletion mutations in mice to understand PWS and the mechanism of this IC . Mice harbouring an intragenic deletion in Snrpn are phenotypically normal , suggesting that mutations of SNRPN are not sufficient to induce PWS . Mice with a larger deletion involving both Snrpn and the putative PWS-IC lack expression of the imprinted genes Zfp127 ( mouse homologue of ZNF127 ) , Ndn and Ipw , and manifest several phenotypes common to PWS infants .

"Human peroxisomal targeting signal-1 receptor restores peroxisomal protein import in cells from patients with fatal peroxisomal disorders. Two peroxisomal targeting signals , PTS1 and PTS2 , are involved in the import of proteins into the peroxisome matrix . Human patients with fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall into at least nine genetic complementation groups . Cells from many of these patients are deficient in the import of PTS1-containing proteins , but the causes of the protein-import defect in these patients are unknown . We have cloned and sequenced the human cDNA homologue ( PTS1R ) of the Pichia pastoris PAS8 gene , the PTS1 receptor ( McCollum , D . , E . Monosov , and S . Subramani . 1993 . J . Cell Biol . 121  761-774 ) . The PTS1R mRNA is expressed in all human tissues examined . Antibodies to the human PTS1R recognize this protein in human , monkey , rat , and hamster cells . The protein is localized mainly in the cytosol but is also found to be associated with peroxisomes . Part of the peroxisomal PTS1R protein is tightly bound to the peroxisomal membrane . Antibodies to PTS1R inhibit peroxisomal protein-import of PTS1-containing proteins in a permeabilized CHO cell system . In vitro-translated PTS1R protein specifically binds a serine-lysine-leucine-peptide . A PAS8-PTS1R fusion protein complements the P . pastoris pas8 mutant . The PTS1R cDNA also complements the PTS1 protein-import defect in skin fibroblasts from patients--belonging to complementation group two--diagnosed as having neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy or Zellweger syndrome . The PTS1R gene has been localized to a chromosomal location where no other peroxisomal disorder genes are known to map . Our findings represent the only case in which the molecular basis of the protein-import deficiency in human peroxisomal disorders is understood .",0,0,1,0
"Indomethacin-induced renal insufficiency: recurrence on rechallenge. We have reported a case of acute oliguric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis, ascites, and cor pulmonale after indomethacin therapy. Prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal, while re-exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible oliguria. Our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is diminished. Since nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure, they should be used with caution in such patients.",0,1,0,0
"Experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin: a PET study. Using a positron emission tomography (PET) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state, but not in the headache free interval. It was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called 'migraine generator'. To test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers, using the same positioning in the PET scanner as in the migraine patients. A small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal nerve. Increases of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were found bilaterally in the insula, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the cavernous sinus and the cerebellum. Using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free state. The increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however, suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such, rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache.",0,0,1,0
"Decreased Expression of Na/K-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1 and OAT in Gentamicin-induced Nephropathy. The present study was aimed to determine whether there is an altered regulation of tubular transporters in gentamicin-induced nephropathy. Sprague-Dawley male rats (200~250 g) were subcutaneously injected with gentamicin (100 mg/kg per day) for 7 days, and the expression of tubular transporters was determined by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The mRNA and protein expression of OAT was also determined. Gentamicin-treated rats exhibited significantly decreased creatinine clearance along with increased plasma creatinine levels. Accordingly, the fractional excretion of sodium increased. Urine volume was increased, while urine osmolality and free water reabsorption were decreased. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry revealed decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, and AQP1 in the kidney of gentamicin-treated rats. The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was also decreased. Gentamicin-induced nephropathy may at least in part be causally related with a decreased expression of Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, NHE3, NBC1, AQP1 and OAT.",0,1,0,0

"Succimer chelation improves learning, attention, and arousal regulation in lead-exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure. BACKGROUND: There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels. However, very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children, or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure. OBJECTIVES: The present study was designed to answer these questions, using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer, a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning. RESULTS: Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning, attention, inhibitory control, and arousal regulation, paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb-exposed children. Succimer treatment of the Pb-exposed rats significantly improved learning, attention, and arousal regulation, although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit. In contrast, succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data, to our knowledge, to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure. These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb-exposed children. However, they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals.",0,0,1,0

"Behavioral effects of urotensin-II centrally administered in mice. Urotensin-II (U-II) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of U-II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion. However, the behavioral effects of centrally administered U-II have received little attention. In the present study, we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of U-II on behavioral, metabolic, and endocrine responses in mice. Administration of graded doses of U-II (1-10,000 ng/mouse) provoked: (1) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole-board test; (2) a dose-dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black-and-white compartment test, and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus-maze test; and (3) a dose-dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced-swimming test and tail suspension test. Intracerebroventricular injection of U-II also caused an increase in: food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng/mouse, water intake at doses of 100-10,000 ng/mouse, and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng/mouse. Whatever was the dose, the central administration of U-II had no effect on body temperature, nociception, apomorphine-induced penile erection and climbing behavior, and stress-induced plasma corticosterone level. Taken together, the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U-II at doses of 1-10,000 ng/mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant-like effects in mouse. These data suggest that U-II may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders.",1,0,1,0

"Hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transplantation. Hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high-dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transplantation. As standard practice at our institution, patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophylactically with forced hydration and bladder irrigation. In an attempt to obviate the inconvenience of bladder irrigation, we conducted a feasibility trial of uroprophylaxis with mesna, which neutralizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cystitis. Of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis, 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cystitis. In contrast, two of four consecutive patients who received mesna uroprophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 weeks. Because of this suboptimal result, we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis.",0,1,0,0

Molecular , kinetic , and functional studies were carried out on erythrocytes and leukocytes in a Spanish male with G6PD deficiency , congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia ( CNSHA ) , and increased susceptibility to infections . G6PD activity was absent in patients red cells and was about 2 % of normal in leukocytes . Molecular studies using standard methods ( WHO , 1967 ) showed G6PD in the patient to have a slightly fast electrophoretic mobility at pH 8 . 0 with otherwise normal properties ( heat stability at 46 degrees C , apparent affinity for substrates , optimum pH , and utilization of substrate analogues ) . Other tests showed the patients granulocytes to engulf latex particles normally , but to have impaired reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and ferricytochrome-c as well as reduced iodination . Chemotaxis and random migration of the patients granulocytes were normal as were myeloperoxidase , leukocyte alkaline phosphatase ( LAP ) , and ultrastructural features . The molecular characteristics of G6PD in the patient differed from those of all previously reported variants associated with CNSHA , so the present variant was provisionally called G6PD Barcelona to distinguish it from other G6PD variants previously described .

"Cholesteryl hemisuccinate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen, adriamycin, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and galactosamine. In addition to its use as a stabilizer/rigidifier of membranes, cholesteryl hemisuccinate, tris salt (CS) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepatotoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). To further our understanding of the mechanism of CS cytoprotection, we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of CS and the non-hydrolyzable ether form of CS, gamma-cholesteryloxybutyric acid, tris salt (CSE) against acetaminophen-, adriamycin-, carbon tetrachloride-, chloroform- and galactosamine-induced toxicity. The results of these studies demonstrated that CS-mediated protection is not selective for a particular species, organ system or toxic chemical. A 24-h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of CS (100mg/kg, i.p.), resulted in significant protection against the hepatotoxic effects of CCl4, CHCl3, acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal (and presumably cardiotoxic) effect of adriamycin administration. Maximal CS-mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insult. These data suggest that CS intervenes in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell death. The mechanism of CS protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bioactivation to a toxic reactive intermediate (in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity). However, based on the data presented, we can not exclude the possibility that CS administration inhibits chemical bioactivation. Our findings do suggest that CS-mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic CS molecule (non-hydrolyzable CSE was as protective as CS), whose mechanism has yet to be defined.",1,0,0,0
"Population-based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives. BACKGROUND: Four studies published since December, 1995, reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives (OCs) containing the third-generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second-generation progestagens. However, confounding and bias in the design of these studies may have affected the findings. The aim of our study was to re-examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies. METHODS: We used computer records of patients from 143 general practices in the UK. The study was based on the medical records of about 540,000 women born between 1941 and 1981. All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep-vein thrombosis, venous thrombosis not otherwise specified, or pulmonary embolus during the study period, and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE. We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations, and a nested case-control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. In the case-control study, we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth, practice, and current use of OCs. We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body-mass index, number of cycles, change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event, previous pregnancy, and concurrent disease. FINDINGS: 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE, two of whom were users of progestagen-only OCs. Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs, 43 were recorded as deep-vein thrombosis, 35 as pulmonary thrombosis, and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified. The crude rate of VTE per 10,000 woman-years was 4.10 in current users of any OC, 3.10 in users of second-generation OCs, and 4.96 in users of third-generation preparations. After adjustment for age, the rate ratio of VTE in users of third-generation relative to second-generation OCs was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.75). Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third-generation and second-generation OCs. Among users of third-generation progestagens, the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol. With all second-generation OCs as the reference, the odds ratios for VTE were 3.49 (1.21-10.12) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 (0.66-2.17) for the other third-generation progestagens. INTERPRETATION: The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third-generation OCs when compared with second-generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age. The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible, and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and, thus, confounding.",0,0,1,0

Thalidomide is an immunomodulatory agent with demonstrated activity in multiple myeloma, mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Its activity is believed to be due modulation of the tumour milieu, including downregulation of angiogenesis and inflammatory cytokines.

"Memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ecstasy (MDMA) users. Although 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has been shown to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals and possibly humans, little is known about the long-term consequences of MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5-HT is involved, such as cognitive function. Because 5-HT transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5-HT transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5-HT transporter promoter gene region (5-HTTLPR) when studying the effects of MDMA as well as cognitive functioning. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use on cognitive function, as well as the effects of long-term abstention from MDMA, in subjects genotyped for 5-HTTLPR. A second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and males. Fifteen moderate MDMA users (<55 lifetime tablets), 22 heavy MDMA+ users (>55 lifetime tablets), 16 ex-MDMA+ users (last tablet > 1 year ago) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests. DNA from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5-HTTLPR using standard polymerase chain reaction methods.A significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks (p = 0.04) but not on reaction times (p = 0.61) or attention/executive functioning (p = 0.59). Heavy and ex-MDMA+ users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than controls. In contrast, no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate MDMA users. No significant effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender was observed. While the use of MDMA in quantities that may be considered ""moderate"" is not associated with impaired memory functioning, heavy use of MDMA use may lead to long lasting memory impairments. No effect of 5-HTTLPR or gender on memory function or MDMA use was observed.",0,0,1,0

"Homozygous presence of the crossover (fusion gene) mutation identified in a type II Gaucher disease fetus: is this analogous to the Gaucher knock-out mouse model?. Gaucher disease ( GD ) is an inherited deficiency of beta-glucocerebrosidase ( EC 3 . 1 . 2 . 45 , gene symbol GBA ) . In type I GD , the CNS is not involved ( nonneuronopathic ) , whereas in type II GD ( acute neuronopathic ) CNS involvement is early and rapidly progressive , while in type III GD ( subacute neuronopathic ) CNS involvement occurs later and is slowly progressive . The T6433C ( L444P ) substitution is prevalent in type GD II . It may occur alone as a single base-pair mutation but often is found as part of a complex allele containing additional GBA nucleotide substitutions , G6468C ( A456P ) and G6482C ( V460V ) , without ( recNciI ) or with ( recTL ) G5957C ( D409H ) .

"Heterozygous loss of Six5 in mice is sufficient to cause ocular cataracts. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by skeletal muscle wasting , myotonia , cardiac arrhythmia , hyperinsulinaemia , mental retardation and ocular cataracts . The genetic defect in DM is a CTG repeat expansion located in the 3 untranslated region of DMPK and 5 of a homeodomain-encoding gene , SIX5 ( formerly DMAHP ; refs 2-5 ) . There are three mechanisms by which CTG expansion can result in DM . First , repeat expansion may alter the processing or transport of the mutant DMPK mRNA and consequently reduce DMPK levels . Second , CTG expansion may establish a region of heterochromatin 3 of the repeat sequence and decrease SIX5 transcription . Third , toxic effects of the repeat expansion may be intrinsic to the repeated elements at the level of DNA or RNA ( refs 10 , 11 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that a dose-dependent loss of Dm15 ( the mouse DMPK homologue ) in mice produces a partial DM phenotype characterized by decreased development of skeletal muscle force and cardiac conduction disorders . To test the role of Six5 loss in DM , we have analysed a strain of mice in which Six5 was deleted . Our results demonstrate that the rate and severity of cataract formation is inversely related to Six5 dosage and is temporally progressive . Six5 + / - and Six5- / - mice show increased steady-state levels of the Na + / K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit and decreased Dm15 mRNA levels . Thus , altered ion homeostasis within the lens may contribute to cataract formation . As ocular cataracts are a characteristic feature of DM , these results demonstrate that decreased SIX5 transcription is important in the aetiology of DM . Our data support the hypothesis that DM is a contiguous gene syndrome associated with the partial loss of both DMPK and SIX5 . .",1,0,1,0

"Reduction of heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Heparan sulphate-associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- adn sex-matched control rats, employing the cationic dye cuprolinic blue. Morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image processor. The heparan sulphate specificity of the cuprolinic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan-degrading enzymes, showing that pretreatment of the sections with heparitinase abolished all staining, whereas chondroitinase ABC had no effect. The majority of anionic sites (74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane. A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna, and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane (p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats, respectively). Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 (32.2-62.0) mg/24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals (0.8 (0.2-0.9) mg/24 h, p<0.002). At the same time, the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface (number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% (p<0.021) and by 26% (p<0.02), respectively. Number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane (lamina densa and lamina rara interna) were not significantly changed. We conclude that in streptozotocin-diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion, a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier/density is found at the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane.",0,1,0,0
"Increased incidence of cancer in patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia . OBJECTIVE  Previous reports have suggested an increased risk of cancer among patients with cartilage-hair hypoplasia (CHH) . This study was carried out to further evaluate this risk among patients with CHH and their first-degree relatives . STUDY DESIGN  One hundred twenty-two patients with CHH were identified through 2 countrywide epidemiologic surveys in 1974 and in 1986 . Their parents and nonaffected siblings were identified through the Population Register Center . This cohort underwent follow-up for cancer incidence through the Finnish Cancer Registry to the end of 1995 . RESULTS  A statistically significant excess risk of cancer was seen among the patients with CHH ( standardized incidence ratio 6 . 9 , 95 % confidence interval 2 . 3 to 16 ) , which was mainly attributable to non-Hodgkins lymphoma  ( standardized incidence ratio 90 , 95 % confidence interval 18 to 264 ) . In addition , a significant excess risk of basal cell carcinoma was seen ( standardized incidence ratio 35 , 95 % confidence interval 7 . 2 to 102 ) . The cancer incidence among the siblings or the parents did not differ from the average cancer incidence in the Finnish population . CONCLUSIONS  This study confirms an increased risk of cancer, especially non-Hodgkins lymphoma , probably attributable to defective immunity , among patients with CHH .",0,0,1,1

"Incidence of neoplasms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis exposed to different treatment regimens. Immunosuppressive drugs have been used during the last 30 years in treatment of patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis. The drugs commonly used are cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil (alkylating agents), azathioprine (purine analogue), and methotrexate (folic acid analogue). There is evidence that all four immunosuppressive drugs can reduce synovitis, but disease activity almost always recurs after therapy is stopped. Since adverse reactions are frequent, less than 50 percent of patients are able to continue a particular drug for more than one year. Since it takes three to 12 months to achieve maximal effects, those patients who are unable to continue the drug receive little benefit from it. Patients treated with alkylating agents have an increased risk of development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, and both alkylating agents and azathioprine are associated with the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cyclophosphamide therapy increases the risk of carcinoma of the bladder. There have been several long-term studies of patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with azathioprine and cyclophosphamide and the incidence of most of the common cancers is not increased. Data on the possible increased risk of malignancy in rheumatoid arthritis are still being collected, and until further information is available, the use of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly alkylating agents, in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis should be reserved for patients with severe progressive disease or life-threatening complications.",0,0,1,1

"Electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic drugs. Eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life-threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs, either phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressants. Although most patients were receiving several drugs, Mellaril (thioridazine) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia, one of which was fatal in a 35 year old woman. Supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving Thorazine (chlorpromazine). Aventyl (nortriptyline) and Elavil (amitriptyline) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old woman. Electrocardiographic T and U wave abnormalities were present in most patients. The ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in one. The tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stopped. Five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger; only one clearly had antecedent heart disease. Major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving customary therapeutic doses of psychotropic drugs. A prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothiazines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs.",1,0,0,0
"Antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of the presynaptic cholinergic amplifier PG-9. The antinociceptive effect of 3 alpha-tropyl 2-(p-bromophenyl)propionate [(+/-)-PG-9] (10-40 mg kg-1 s.c.; 30-60 mg kg-1 p.o.; 10-30 mg kg-1 i.v.; 10-30 micrograms/mouse i.c.v.) was examined in mice, rats and guinea pigs by use of the hot-plate, abdominal-constriction, tail-flick and paw-pressure tests. (+/-)-PG-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished. The antinociception produced by (+/-)-PG-9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine, the M1-selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3, but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone, the gamma-aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3-aminopropyl-diethoxy-methyl-phosphinic acid, the H3 agonist R-(alpha)-methylhistamine, the D2 antagonist quinpirole, the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride, the 5-hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine. Based on these data, it can be postulated that (+/-)-PG-9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission. (+/-)-PG-9 (10-40 mg kg-1 i.p.) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine (1 mg kg-1 i.p.) and dicyclomine (2 mg kg-1 i.p.) in the mouse passive-avoidance test. Affinity profiles of (+/-)-PG-9 for muscarinic receptor subtypes, determined by functional studies (rabbit vas deferens for M1, guinea pig atrium for M2, guinea pig ileum for M3 and immature guinea pig uterus for putative M4), have shown an M4/M1 selectivity ratio of 10.2 that might be responsible for the antinociception and the anti-amnesic effect induced by (+/-)-PG-9 through an increase in acetylcholine extracellular levels. In the antinociceptive and antiamnesic dose range, (+/-)-PG-9 did not impair mouse performance evaluated by the rota-rod test and Animex apparatus.",0,0,1,0
"Cardioprotective effect of tincture of Crataegus on isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Tincture of Crataegus (TCR), an alcoholic extract of the berries of hawthorn (Crataegus oxycantha), is used in herbal and homeopathic medicine. The present study was done to investigate the protective effect of TCR on experimentally induced myocardial infarction in rats. Pretreatment of TCR, at a dose of 0.5 mL/100 g bodyweight per day, orally for 30 days, prevented the increase in lipid peroxidation and activity of marker enzymes observed in isoproterenol-induced rats (85 mg kg(-1) s. c. for 2 days at an interval of 24 h). TCR prevented the isoproterenol-induced decrease in antioxidant enzymes in the heart and increased the rate of ADP-stimulated oxygen uptake and respiratory coupling ratio. TCR protected against pathological changes induced by isoproterenol in rat heart. The results show that pretreatment with TCR may be useful in preventing the damage induced by isoproterenol in rat heart.",1,0,0,0

"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene is required for cell cycle exit upon serum withdrawal. The inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) tumor suppressor gene predisposes affected individuals to the human VHL cancer syndrome and is associated with sporadic renal cell carcinomas ( RCC ) and brain hemangioblastomas . VHL-negative 786-0 RCC cells are tumorigenic in nude mice which is suppressed by the reintroduction of VHL . Remarkably , this occurs without affecting the growth rate and cell cycle profile of these cells in culture . The 786-0 cell line , like many cancer cells , fails to exit the cell cycle upon serum withdrawal . Here , it is shown that reintroduction of the wild-type VHL gene restores the ability of VHL-negative RCC cancer cells to exit the cell cycle and enter G0 / quiescence in low serum . Both VHL-positive and VHL-negative RCC cells exit the cell cycle by contact inhibition . The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , p27 , accumulates upon serum withdrawal , only in the presence of VHL , as a result of the stabilization of the protein . We propose that the loss of wild-type VHL gene results in a specific cellular defect in serum-dependent growth control , which may initiate tumor formation . This is corrected by the reintroduction of wild-type VHL , implicating VHL as the first tumor suppressor involved in the regulation of cell cycle exit , which is consistent with its gatekeeper function in the kidney . .",0,1,1,1
"Kidney function and morphology after short-term combination therapy with cyclosporine A, tacrolimus and sirolimus in the rat. BACKGROUND: Sirolimus (SRL) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation. These are nephrotoxic, but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects, although this question is still open. In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described. The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function, including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A (CsA), tacrolimus (FK506) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations. METHODS: For a period of 2 weeks, CsA 15 mg/kg/day (given orally), FK506 3.0 mg/kg/day (given orally) or SRL 0.4 mg/kg/day (given intraperitoneally) was administered once a day as these doses have earlier been found to achieve a significant immunosuppressive effect in Sprague-Dawley rats. In the 'conscious catheterized rat' model, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was measured as the clearance of Cr(EDTA). The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi-quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis, subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules, plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red. RESULTS: CsA, FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR. A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL, whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances. The morphological changes presented a similar pattern. The semi-quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL (P<0.001 compared with controls) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls (P<0.02). The FK506 plus SRL combination showed only a marginally higher degree of fibrosis as compared with controls (P=0.05). CONCLUSION: This rat study demonstrated a synergistic nephrotoxic effect of CsA plus SRL, whereas FK506 plus SRL was better tolerated.",0,1,1,0

"Methimazole-induced cholestatic jaundice. Methimazole is a widely used and generally well-tolerated antithyroid agent. A 43-year-old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving methimazole (10 mg tid) and propranolol (20 mg tid) for treatment of hyperthyroidism. The patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medications. When seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later, she still had severe icterus, pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia, formed mainly of the conjugated fraction. Methimazole-induced cholestasis was diagnosed, and propranolol therapy was resumed. Over the following 9 days, the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without methimazole. In rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy, this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaundice. Physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that, upon occurrence, they can discontinue methimazole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures.",0,0,1,0

Fever and subsequent multiple painful erythematous nodules over extremities developed on D11, D16, D17, and D19, respectively, after ATRA therapy. The skin biopsy taken from each patient was consistent with erythema nodosum. All patients received short course of steroids. Fever subsided rapidly and the skin lesions regressed completely. All patients achieved complete remission without withdrawal of ATRA. ATRA seemed to be the most possible etiology of erythema nodosum in our patients.

"Development of proteinuria after switch to sirolimus-based immunosuppression in long-term cardiac transplant patients. Calcineurin-inhibitor therapy can lead to renal dysfunction in heart transplantation patients. The novel immunosuppressive (IS) drug sirolmus (Srl) lacks nephrotoxic effects; however, proteinuria associated with Srl has been reported following renal transplantation. In cardiac transplantation, the incidence of proteinuria associated with Srl is unknown. In this study, long-term cardiac transplant patients were switched from cyclosporine to Srl-based IS. Concomitant IS consisted of mycophenolate mofetil +/- steroids. Proteinuria increased significantly from a median of 0.13 g/day (range 0-5.7) preswitch to 0.23 g/day (0-9.88) at 24 months postswitch (p = 0.0024). Before the switch, 11.5% of patients had high-grade proteinuria (>1.0 g/day); this increased to 22.9% postswitch (p = 0.006). ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-releasing blocker (ARB) therapy reduced proteinuria development. Patients without proteinuria had increased renal function (median 42.5 vs. 64.1, p = 0.25), whereas patients who developed high-grade proteinuria showed decreased renal function at the end of follow-up (median 39.6 vs. 29.2, p = 0.125). Thus, proteinuria may develop in cardiac transplant patients after switch to Srl, which may have an adverse effect on renal function in these patients. Srl should be used with ACEi/ARB therapy and patients monitored for proteinuria and increased renal dysfunction.",1,1,0,0
"A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene. BACKGROUND AND METHODS  Hereditary hemochromatosis is associated with homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the hemochromatosis ( HFE ) gene on chromosome 6 , elevated serum transferrin saturation , and excess iron deposits throughout the body . To assess the prevalence and clinical expression of the HFE gene , we conducted a population-based study in Busselton , Australia . In 1994 , we obtained blood samples for the determination of serum transferrin saturation and ferritin levels and the presence or absence of the C282Y mutation and the H63D mutation ( which may contribute to increased hepatic iron levels ) in 3011 unrelated white adults . We evaluated all subjects who had persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values ( 45 percent or higher ) or were homozygous for the C282Y mutation . We recommended liver biopsy for subjects with serum ferritin levels of 300 ng per milliliter or higher . The subjects were followed for up to four years . RESULTS  Sixteen of the subjects ( 0 . 5 percent ) were homozygous for the C282Y mutation , and 424 ( 14 . 1 percent ) were heterozygous . The serum transferrin saturation was 45 percent or higher in 15 of the 16 who were homozygous ; in 1 subject it was 43 percent . Four of the homozygous subjects had previously been given a diagnosis of hemochromatosis , and 12 had not . Seven of these 12 patients had elevated serum ferritin levels in 1994 ; 6 of the 7 had further increases in 1998 , and 1 had a decrease , although the value remained elevated . The serum ferritin levels in the four other homozygous patients remained in the normal range . Eleven of the 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy ; 3 had hepatic fibrosis , and 1 , who had a history of excessive alcohol consumption , had cirrhosis and mild microvesicular steatosis . Eight of the 16 homozygous subjects had clinical findings that were consistent with the presence of hereditary hemochromatosis , such as hepatomegaly , skin pigmentation , and arthritis . CONCLUSIONS  In a population of white adults of northern European ancestry , 0 . 5 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene . However , only half of those who were homozygous had clinical features of hemochromatosis , and one quarter had serum ferritin levels that remained normal over a four-year period .",0,1,0,0

"Nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bladder. PURPOSE: NGF and PGs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in urine. We investigated changes in urinary NGF and PGs in women with OAB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study groups included 65 women with OAB and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as controls. Evaluation included patient history, urinalysis, a voiding diary and urodynamic studies. Urine samples were collected. NGF, PGE2, PGF2alpha and PGI2 were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the groups. In addition, correlations between urinary NGF and PG, and urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB were examined. RESULTS: Urinary NGF, PGE2 and PGF2alpha were significantly increased in patients with OAB compared with controls (p <0.05). However, urinary PGI2 was not different between controls and patients with OAB. In patients with OAB urinary PGE2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cystometric capacity (p <0.05). Urinary NGF, PGF2alpha and PGI2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with OAB. CONCLUSIONS: NGF and PGs have important roles in the development of OAB symptoms in female patients.

"Quinine-induced arrhythmia in a patient with severe malaria. It was reported that there was a case of severe malaria patient with jaundice who presented with arrhythmia (premature ventricular contraction) while getting quinine infusion was reported. A man, 25 years old, was admitted to hospital with high fever, chill, vomiting, jaundice. The patient was fully conscious, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 100 x/minute, regular. On admission, laboratory examination showed Plasmodium falciparum (++++), total bilirubin 8.25 mg/dL, conjugated bilirubin 4.36 mg/dL, unconjugated bilirubin 3.89 mg/dL, potassium 3.52 meq/L Patient was diagnosed as severe malaria with jaundice and got quinine infusion in dextrose 5% 500 mg/8 hour. On the second day the patient had vomitus, diarrhea, tinnitus, loss of hearing. After 30 hours of quinine infusion the patient felt palpitation and electrocardiography (ECG) recording showed premature ventricular contraction (PVC) > 5 x/minute, trigemini, constant type--sinoatrial block, positive U wave. He was treated with lidocaine 50 mg intravenously followed by infusion 1500 mg in dextrose 5%/24 hour and potassium aspartate tablet. Quinine infusion was discontinued and changed with sulfate quinine tablets. Three hours later the patient felt better, the frequency of PVC reduced to 4 - 5 x/minute and on the third day ECG was normal, potassium level was 3.34 meq/L. He was discharged on 7th day in good condition. Quinine, like quinidine, is a chincona alkaloid that has anti-arrhythmic property, although it also pro-arrhythmic that can cause various arrhythmias, including severe arrhythmia such as multiple PVC.

"The effects of dystrophin gene mutations on the ERG in mice and humans. PURPOSE . The authors earlier findings of a negative electroretinogram ( ERG ) in a boy with Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) led them to investigate dystrophin gene deletions and ERGs in five boys with DMD . The authors wanted to determined whether there were similar ERG findings in an animal model for DMD , the mdx mouse . METHODS . Ganzfeld ERGs were recorded in five boys with DMD after a complete ophthalmic examination . The dystrophin gene was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization . ERGs were recorded in anesthetized mdx and control mice with a modified Grass photostimulator ( Grass Instrument Company , Quincy , MA ) . RESULTS . Ophthalmic examinations in all five boys had normal findings , yet an abnormal negative ERG was recorded for each subject . The subjects gene deletions were variable , ranging from large deletions to no detectable deletions . The ERGs of the mdx mice were normal and did not differ significantly from those of the control mice . CONCLUSIONS . The authors believe the unique ERG recorded for the human subjects is a manifestation of DMD associated with defects at the dystrophin gene locus and represents a new clinical entity . The ERG of the mdx mouse may be spared for several reasons , including milder effects of the mouse gene defect , differences in muscle and retinal gene product , or species differences in the biochemical role of dystrophin . The ERG shows promise of becoming a noninvasive diagnostic tool for DMD and its milder allelic forms . .",0,0,1,0

"Long term hormone therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. BACKGROUND: Hormone therapy (HT) is widely used for controlling menopausal symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and dementia in older women. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review first published in 2005. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of long-term HT on mortality, cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, gallbladder disease, cognition, fractures and quality of life. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the following databases to November 2007: Trials Register of the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Biological Abstracts. Also relevant non-indexed journals and conference abstracts. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised double-blind trials of HT versus placebo, taken for at least one year by perimenopausal or postmenopausal women. HT included oestrogens, with or without progestogens, via oral, transdermal, subcutaneous or transnasal routes. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nineteen trials involving 41,904 women were included. In relatively healthy women, combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism or coronary event (after one year's use), stroke (after three years), breast cancer and gallbladder disease. Long-term oestrogen-only HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism, stroke and gallbladder disease (after one to two years, three years and seven years' use respectively), but did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer. The only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and (for combined HT) colon cancer, with long-term use. Among women aged over 65 who were relatively healthy (i.e. generally fit, without overt disease) and taking continuous combined HT, there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia. Among women with cardiovascular disease, long-term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thrombo-embolism.One trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen-only HT, versus similar-sized placebo groups. The only significantly increased risk reported was for venous thrombo-embolism in women taking combined continuous HT: their absolute risk remained low, at less than 1/500. However, this study was not powered to detect differences between groups of younger women. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HT is not indicated for the routine management of chronic disease.

We compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol (cardioselective), 40 mg propranolol (nonselective), and placebo on both exercise- and isoproterenol-induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjects. Maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 +/- 4(SEM) after placebo to 146 +/- 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 +/- 6 bpm after propranolol, but there were no differences between the drugs. The effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine (0.04 mg/kg IV). Isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm (CD25) and this was increased from 1.8 +/- 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 +/- 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 +/- 1.7 micrograms after atenolol. The difference in the effects of the two was significant. After atropine the CD25 was unchanged after placebo (2.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms) and atenolol (7.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms); it was reduced after propranolol (24.8 +/- 5.0 micrograms), but remained different from atenolol. This change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent Ka, this was unchanged by atropine (11.7 +/- 2.1 and 10.1 +/- 2.5 ml/ng). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise-induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs, whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug. While there appear to be beta 2-receptors in the human heart, their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined.",1,0,1,0

"Carbimazole induced ANCA positive vasculitis. Anti-thyroid drugs, like carbimazole and propylthiouracil (PTU) are commonly prescribed for the treatment of hyperthyroidism. One should be aware of the side effects of antithyroid medications. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)--associated vasculitis is a potentially life-threatening adverse effect of antithyroidmedications. We report a patient with Graves' disease who developed ANCA positive carbimazole induced vasculitis. The episode was characterized by a vasculitic skin rash associated with large joint arthritis, pyrexia and parotiditis but no renal or pulmonary involvement. He was referred to us for neurological evaluation because he had difficulty in getting up from squatting position and was suspected to have myositis.

"Pharmacology of ACC-9653 (phenytoin prodrug). ACC-9653, the disodium phosphate ester of 3-hydroxymethyl-5,5-diphenylhydantoin, is a prodrug of phenytoin with advantageous physicochemical properties. ACC-9653 is rapidly converted enzymatically to phenytoin in vivo. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have equivalent anticonvulsant activity against seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES) in mice following i.p., oral, or i.v. administration. The ED50 doses were 16 mg/kg for i.v. ACC-9653 and 8 mg/kg for i.v. phenytoin sodium. ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium have similar antiarrhythmic activity against ouabain-induced ventricular tachycardia in anesthetized dogs. The total doses of ACC-9653 or phenytoin sodium necessary to convert the arrhythmia to a normal sinus rhythm were 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 mg/kg, respectively. Only phenytoin sodium displayed in vitro antiarrhythmic activity against strophanthidin-induced arrhythmias in guinea pig right atria. In anesthetized dogs, a high dose of ACC-9653 (31 mg/kg) was infused over 15, 20, and 30 min and the responses were compared to an equimolar dose of phenytoin sodium (21 mg/kg). The ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium treatments produced similar marked reductions in diastolic blood pressure and contractile force (LVdP/dt). The maximum effects of each treatment occurred at the time of maximum phenytoin sodium levels. Acute toxicity studies of ACC-9653 and phenytoin sodium were carried out in mice, rats, rabbits, and dogs by i.v., i.m., and i.p. routes of administration. The systemic toxic signs of both agents were similar and occurred at approximately equivalent doses. Importantly, the local irritation of ACC-9653 was markedly less than phenytoin sodium following i.m. administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0,1,0
"Susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis in twins: the role of genes, HLA, and the environment. OBJECTIVE  To determine the relative effects of genetic and environmental factors in susceptibility to ankylosing spondylitis ( AS ) . METHODS  Twins with AS were identified from the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases database . Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed to establish diagnoses , and disease severity was assessed using a combination of validated scoring systems . HLA typing for HLA-B27 , HLA-B60 , and HLA-DR1 was performed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers , and zygosity was assessed using microsatellite markers . Genetic and environmental variance components were assessed with the program Mx , using data from this and previous studies of twins with AS . RESULTS  Six of 8 monozygotic ( MZ ) twin pairs were disease concordant , compared with 4 of 15 B27-positive dizygotic ( DZ ) twin pairs ( 27 % ) and 4 of 32 DZ twin pairs overall ( 12 . 5 % ) . Nonsignificant increases in similarity with regard to age at disease onset and all of the disease severity scores assessed were noted in disease-concordant MZ twins compared with concordant DZ twins . HLA-B27 and B60 were associated with the disease in probands , and the rate of disease concordance was significantly increased among DZ twin pairs in which the co-twin was positive for both B27 and DR1 . Additive genetic effects were estimated to contribute 97 % of the population variance . CONCLUSION  Susceptibility to AS is largely genetically determined , and the environmental trigger for the disease is probably ubiquitous . HLA-B27 accounts for a minority of the overall genetic susceptibility to AS .",0,0,1,0

"Salicylate nephropathy in the Gunn rat: potential role of prostaglandins. We examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the Gunn strain of rat. The homozygous Gunn rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuronyl transferase, leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papilla. These rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administration. We used homozygous (jj) and phenotypically normal heterozygous (jJ) animals. Four groups of rats (n = 7) were studied: jj and jJ rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg/kg every other day or sham-treated. After one week, slices of cortex, outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radioimmunoassay. The other kidney was examined histologically. A marked corticomedullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all groups. PGE2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla, but not cortex or inner medulla, of jj (38 +/- 6 ng/mg prot) than jJ rats (15 +/- 3) (p less than 0.01). Aspirin treatment reduced PGE2 synthesis in all regions, but outer medullary PGE2 remained higher in jj (18 +/- 3) than jJ rats (9 +/- 2) (p less than 0.05). PGF2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of jj rats with and without aspirin administration (p less than 0.05). The changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin-treated jj but not jJ rats as evidenced by: increased incidence and severity of hematuria (p less than 0.01); increased serum creatinine (p less than 0.05); and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions (p less than 0.005 compared to either sham-treated jj or aspirin-treated jJ). These results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity, and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function.",0,1,0,0

"International mexiletine and placebo antiarrhythmic coronary trial: I. Report on arrhythmia and other findings. Impact Research Group. The antiarrhythmic effects of the sustained release form of mexiletine (Mexitil-Perlongets) were evaluated in a double-blind placebo trial in 630 patients with recent documented myocardial infarction. The primary response variable was based on central reading of 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic recordings and was defined as the occurrence of 30 or more single premature ventricular complexes in any two consecutive 30 minute blocks or one or more runs of two or more premature ventricular complexes in the entire 24 hour electrocardiographic recording. Large differences, regarded as statistically significant, between the mexiletine and placebo groups were noted in that end point at months 1 and 4, but only trends were observed at month 12. These differences were observed even though the serum mexiletine levels obtained in this study were generally lower than those observed in studies that have used the regular form of the drug. There were more deaths in the mexiletine group (7.6%) than in the placebo group (4.8%); the difference was not statistically significant. The incidence of coronary events was similar in both groups. Previously recognized side effects, particularly tremor and gastrointestinal problems, were more frequent in the mexiletine group than in the placebo group.",1,0,1,0
"Relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors. A controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha-bungarotoxin binding. Using mice derived from a classical F2 and backcross genetic design, a relationship between nicotine-induced seizures and alpha-bungarotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found. Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice. The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol, trypsin or heat. Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha-bungarotoxin binding.",0,0,1,0

"Lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy after steroid injection at lateral epicondyle. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This report aimed to present a case of lateral antebrachial cutaneous neuropathy (LACNP) that occurred after a steroid injection in the lateral epicondyle to treat lateral epicondylitis in a 40-year-old woman. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A 40-year-old woman presented with decreased sensation and paresthesia over her right lateral forearm; the paresthesia had occurred after a steroid injection in the right lateral epicondyle 3 months before. Her sensation of light touch and pain was diminished over the lateral side of the right forearm and wrist area. RESULTS: The sensory action potential amplitude of the right lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) (6.2 uV) was lower than that of the left (13.1 uV). The difference of amplitude between both sides was significant because there was more than a 50% reduction. She was diagnosed with right LACNP (mainly axonal involvement) on the basis of the clinical manifestation and the electrodiagnostic findings. Her symptoms improved through physical therapy but persisted to some degree. CONCLUSION: This report describes the case of a woman with LACNP that developed after a steroid injection for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis. An electrodiagnostic study, including a nerve conduction study of the LACN, was helpful to diagnose right LACNP and to find the passage of the LACN on the lateral epicondyle.",0,0,1,0

"Patterns of hepatic injury induced by methyldopa. Twelve patients with liver disease related to methyldopa were seen between 1967 and 1977. Illness occurred within 1--9 weeks of commencement of therapy in 9 patients, the remaining 3 patients having received the drug for 13 months, 15 months and 7 years before experiencing symptoms. Jaundice with tender hepatomegaly, usually preceded by symptoms of malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and associated with upper abdominal pain, was an invariable finding in all patients. Biochemical liver function tests indicated hepatocellular necrosis and correlated with histopathological evidence of hepatic injury, the spectrum of which ranged from fatty change and focal hepatocellular necrosis to massive hepatic necrosis. Most patients showed moderate to severe acute hepatitis or chronic active hepatitis with associated cholestasis. The drug was withdrawn on presentation to hospital in 11 patients, with rapid clinical improvement in 9. One patient died, having presented in hepatic failure, and another, who had been taking methyldopa for 7 years, showed slower clinical and biochemical resolution over a period of several months. The remaining patient in the series developed fulminant hepatitis when the drug was accidentally recommenced 1 year after a prior episode of methyldopa-induced hepatitis. In this latter patient, and in 2 others, the causal relationship between methyldopa and hepatic dysfunction was proved with the recurrence of hepatitis within 2 weeks of re-exposure to the drug.",0,1,1,0
"A prospective study of adverse reactions associated with vancomycin therapy.

"Hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement in man. II. Biological properties of C5-deficient human serum. The first known human kindred with hereditary deficiency of the fifth component of complement ( C5 ) was documented in the accompanying report . This study examines several biological properties of C5-deficient ( C5D ) human serum , particularly sera obtained from two C5D homozygotes . The proband , who has inactive systemic lupus erythematosus is completely lacking C5 , while her healthy half-sister has 1-2 % of normal levels . Both sera were severely impaired in their ability to generate chemotactic activity for normal human neutrophils upon incubation with aggregated human gamma-globulin or Escherichia coli endotoxin . This function was fully restored in the siblings serum , and substantially improved in the probands serum , by addition of highly purified human C5 to normal serum concentrations . Sera from eight family members who were apparently heterozygous for C5 deficiency gave normal chemotactic scores . The ability of C5D serum to opsonize Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( bakers yeast ) or Candida albicans for ingestion by normal neutrophils was completely normal . In addition , C5D serum was capable of promoting normal phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus . The probands serum was incapable of mediating lysis of erythrocytes from a patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria in both the sucrose hemolysia and acid hemolysis tests , and also lacked bactericidal activity against sensitized or unsensitized Salmonella typhi . The siblings serum , containing only 1-2 % of normal C5 , effectively lysed S . typhi , but only at eightfold lower serum dilutions as compared to normals . These findings underscore the critical role of C5 in the generation of chemotactic activity and in cytolytic reactions , as opposed to a nonobligatory or minimal role in opsonization , at least for the organisms under study . .",0,0,1,0
"The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene product interacts with Sp1 to repress vascular endothelial growth factor promoter activity. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene ( VHL ) has a critical role in the pathogenesis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) , as VHL mutations have been found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs . Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) mRNA is upregulated in RCC- and von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors . We have therefore assessed the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression . VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs were transiently cotransfected with a wild-type VHL ( wt-VHL ) vector in several cell lines , including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines . wt-VHL protein inhibited VEGF promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner up to 5- to 10-fold . Deletion analysis defined a 144-bp region of the VEGF promoter necessary for VHL repression . This VHL-responsive element is GC rich and specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts . In Drosophila cells , cotransfected VHL represses Sp1-mediated activation but not basal activity of the VEGF promoter . We next demonstrated in coimmunoprecipitates that VHL and Sp1 were part of the same complex and , by using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1 , that VHL and Sp1 directly interact . Furthermore , endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt-VHL , and nuclear run-on studies indicated that VHL regulation of VEGF occurs at least partly at the transcriptional level . These observations support a new mechanism for VHL-mediated transcriptional repression via a direct inhibitory action on Sp1 and suggest that loss of Sp1 inhibition may be important in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC . .",0,1,0,1

"Glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by NMDA receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol-induced catalepsy. The inferior colliculus (IC) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information, but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system. Functional evidence relating the IC to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the IC by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing, escape-like behavior, and immobility. However, the nature of this immobility is still unclear. The present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid-mediated mechanisms in the IC on the catalepsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically (1 or 0.5 mg/kg) in rats. Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was challenged with prior intracollicular microinjections of glutamate NMDA receptor antagonists, MK-801 (15 or 30 mmol/0.5 microl) and AP7 (10 or 20 nmol/0.5 microl), or of the NMDA receptor agonist N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA, 20 or 30 nmol/0.5 microl). The results showed that intracollicular microinjection of MK-801 and AP7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catalepsy, as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar. Accordingly, intracollicular microinjection of NMDA increased the latency to step down the bar. These findings suggest that glutamate-mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the IC level influence haloperidol-induced catalepsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity.",0,0,1,0

"Absence of acute cerebral vasoconstriction after cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage. INTRODUCTION: Cocaine use has been associated with neurovascular complications, including arterial vasoconstriction and vasculitis. However, there are few studies of angiographic effects of cocaine on human cerebral arteries. Information on these effects could be obtained from angiograms of patients with cocaine-associated subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) who underwent angiography shortly after cocaine use. METHODS: We screened patients with SAH retrospectively and identified those with positive urine toxicology for cocaine or its metabolites. Quantitative arterial diameter measurements from angiograms of these patients were compared to measurements from control patients with SAH who were matched for factors known to influence arterial diameter. Qualitative comparisons of small artery changes also were made. RESULTS: Thirteen patients with positive cocaine toxicology were compared to 26 controls. There were no significant differences between groups in the mean diameters of the intradural internal carotid, sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral, precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral, or basilar arteries (p greater than 0.05 for all comparisons, unpaired t-tests). There also were no significant differences between groups when expressing diameters as the sum of the precommunicating segment of the anterior cerebral + sphenoidal segment of the middle cerebral + supraclinoid internal carotid artery + basilar artery divided by the diameter of the petrous internal carotid artery (p greater than 0.05, unpaired t-tests). Qualitative assessments showed two arterial irregularities in the distal vasculature in each group. CONCLUSION: No quantitative evidence for narrowing of large cerebral arteries or qualitative angiographic evidence for distal narrowing or vasculitis could be found in patients who underwent angiography after aneurysmal SAH associated with cocaine use.",1,0,1,0
"Mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin-mediated nephropathy in rats. Studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin (GM)-mediated nephropathy. Administration of GM at 40 mg/kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow (RBF) and inulin clearance (CIn) as well as marked tubular damage. A significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin-1 contents were also observed in GM-mediated nephropathy. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) or dimethylthiourea (DMTU) significantly lessened the GM-induced decrement in CIn. The SOD-induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF, an increase in urinary cGMP excretion, and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content. SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage. In contrast, DMTU significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation, but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive substances. Neither SOD nor DMTU affected the renal cortical GM content in GM-treated rats. These results suggest that 1) both SOD and DMTU have protective effects on GM-mediated nephropathy, 2) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for SOD and DMTU, and 3) superoxide anions play a critical role in GM-induced renal vasoconstriction.",0,1,1,0
"Metformin protects against seizures, learning and memory impairments and oxidative damage induced by pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling in mice. Cognitive impairment, the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy, greatly diminishes the quality of life. However, current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects. Thus, there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits. Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits, and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential. Metformin, the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug, has antioxidant properties. This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures, cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole-induced kindling animals. Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole (37 mg/kg, i.p.) every other day for 14 injections. Metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg/kg along with alternate-day PTZ. We found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling, ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress. Thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures.",0,0,1,0
"Detection of heterozygous carriers of the ataxia-telangiectasia (ATM) gene by G2 phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of peripheral blood lymphocytes. In ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients , mutations in a single gene , ATM , result in an autosomal recessive syndrome that embraces a variety of clinical features and manifests extreme radiosensitivity and a strong pre-disposition to malignancy . Heterozygotes for the ATM gene have no clinical expression of A-T but may be cancer prone with a moderate increase in in vitro radiosensitivity . We performed a blind chromosomal analysis on G2-phase lymphocytes from 7 unrelated A-T patients , 13 obligate A-T heterozygotes ( parents of the patients ) , and 14 normal controls following X-irradiation with 1 Gy in order to evaluate this cytogenetic method as a tool for detection of ATM carriers . Both A-T homozygotes and heterozygotes showed significantly increased levels of radiation-induced chromatid damage relative to that of normal controls . These results show that the G2-phase chromosomal radiosensitivity assay can be used for the detection of A-T heterozygotes . In combination with molecular genetic analyses , this test may be of value in studies of familial and sporadic cancers aimed at determination of the potential involvement of ATM mutations in tumor risk or development . .",0,0,1,1

"Intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil-induced rigidity. Intracranial pressure (ICP) was measured during alfentanil-induced rigidity in rats. Ten rats had arterial, central venous (CVP), and subdural cannulae inserted under halothane anesthesia. The animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve normocarbia (PCO2 = 42 +/- 1 mmHg, mean +/- SE). Following instrumentation, halothane was discontinued and alfentanil (125 mu/kg) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesia. In the five rats that developed somatic rigidity, ICP and CVP increased significantly above baseline (delta ICP 7.5 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta CVP 5.9 +/- 1.3 mmHg). These variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with metocurine. In five rats that did not become rigid, ICP and CVP did not change following alfentanil. These observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil, and, presumably, other opiates, are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ICP problems.",0,0,1,0
"Risk of coronary artery disease associated with initial sulphonylurea treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a matched case-control study. AIMS: This study sought to assess the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) associated with initial treatment of type 2 diabetes with different sulphonylureas. METHODS: In type 2 diabetic patients, cases who developed CAD were compared retrospectively with controls that did not. The 20-year risk of CAD at diagnosis of diabetes, using the UKPDS risk engine, was used to match cases with controls. RESULTS: The 76 cases of CAD were compared with 152 controls. The hazard of developing CAD (95% CI) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold (1.3-4.3, P=0.004) with glibenclamide; 2-fold (0.9-4.6, P=0.099) with glipizide; 2.9-fold (1.6-5.1, P=0.000) with either, and was unchanged with metformin. The hazard decreased 0.3-fold (0.7-1.7, P=0.385) with glimepiride, 0.4-fold (0.7-1.3, P=0.192) with gliclazide, and 0.4-fold (0.7-1.1, P=0.09) with either. CONCLUSIONS: Initiating treatment of type 2 diabetes with glibenclamide or glipizide is associated with increased risk of CAD in comparison to gliclazide or glimepiride. If confirmed, this may be important because most Indian patients receive the cheaper older sulphonylureas, and present guidelines do not distinguish between individual agents.",1,0,1,0

"Understanding the molecular basis of fragile X syndrome. Fragile X syndrome , a common form of inherited mental retardation , is mainly caused by massive expansion of CGG triplet repeats located in the 5-untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation-1 ( FMR1 ) gene . In patients with fragile X syndrome , the expanded CGG triplet repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the FMR1 gene is repressed , which leads to the absence of FMR1 protein ( FMRP ) and subsequent mental retardation . FMRP is an RNA-binding protein that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm . This protein has been implicated in protein translation as it is found associated with polyribosomes and the rough endoplasmic reticulum . We discuss here the recent progress made towards understanding the molecular mechanism of CGG repeat expansion and physiological function ( s ) of FMRP . These studies will not only help to illuminate the molecular basis of the general class of human diseases with trinucleotide repeat expansion but also provide an avenue to understand aspects of human cognition and intelligence . .",0,0,1,0

"Clinicopathologic features of BRCA-linked and sporadic ovarian cancer. CONTEXT  Most hereditary ovarian cancers are associated with germline mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . Attempts to define the clinical significance of BRCA mutation status in ovarian cancer have produced conflicting results , especially regarding survival . OBJECTIVE  To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers have distinct clinical and pathological features compared with sporadic ( nonhereditary ) ovarian cancers . DESIGN AND SETTING  Retrospective cohort study of a consecutive series of 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed and treated at our institution , which is a comprehensive cancer center as designated by the National Cancer Institute , over a 12-year period ( December 1986 to August 1998 ) . PATIENTS  The study was restricted to patients of Jewish origin because of the ease of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genotyping in this ethnic group . From the 189 patients who identified themselves as Jewish , 88 hereditary cases were identified with the presence of a germline founder mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 . The remaining 101 cases from the same series not associated with a BRCA mutation and 2 additional groups ( Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 and 111 ) with ovarian cancer from clinical trials ( for the survival analysis ) were included for comparison . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  Age at diagnosis , surgical stage , histologic cell type and grade , and surgical outcome ; and response to chemotherapy and survival for advanced-stage ( II and IV ) cases . RESULTS  Hereditary cancers were rarely diagnosed before age 40 years and were common after age 60 years , with mean age at diagnosis being significantly younger for BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients ( 54 vs 62 years ; P = . 04 ) . Histology , grade , stage , and success of cytoreductive surgery were similar for hereditary and sporadic cases . The hereditary group had a longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy in comparison with the nonhereditary group , with a median time to recurrence of 14 months and 7 months , respectively ( P hereditary cancers had improved survival compared with the nonhereditary group ( P = . 004 ) . For stage III cancers , BRCA mutation status was an independent prognostic variable ( P = . 03 ) . CONCLUSIONS  Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers in this population have surgical and pathological characteristics similar to those of sporadic cancers , advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer than nonhereditary cancer patients . Age penetrance is greater for BRCA1-linked than for BRCA2-linked cancers in this population .",0,0,1,1

"Predictors of decreased renal function in patients with heart failure during angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy: results from the studies of left ventricular dysfunction (SOLVD). BACKGROUND: Although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy reduces mortality rates in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF), it may also cause decreased renal function. Little information is available to predict which patients are at highest risk for this complication. OBJECTIVE: To quantify specific clinical predictors of reduction in renal function in patients with CHF who are prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy. METHOD: We analyzed data from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of enalapril for the treatment of CHF. There were 3379 patients randomly assigned to enalapril with a median follow-up of 974 days and 3379 patients randomly assigned to placebo with a mean follow-up of 967 days. Decreased renal function was defined as a rise in serum creatinine >/=0.5 mg/dL (44 micromol/L) from baseline. We used time-to-event analysis to identify potential predictors of decrease in renal function including age, baseline ejection fraction, baseline creatinine, low systolic blood pressure (<100 mm Hg), history of hypertension, diabetes, and use of antiplatelet, diuretic, and beta-blocker therapy. RESULTS: Patients randomly assigned to enalapril had a 33% greater likelihood of decreased renal function than controls (P =.003). By multivariate analysis, in both the placebo and enalapril groups older age, diuretic therapy, and diabetes were associated with decreased renal function, whereas beta-blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective. Older age was associated with a greater risk of developing decreased renal function in both groups, but significantly more so in the enalapril group (enalapril: risk ratio [RR] 1.42 per 10 years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-1.52 with enalapril; placebo: RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12-1.25). Diuretic therapy was likewise associated with a greater risk of decreased renal function in the enalapril group (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.70-2.08) than in the placebo group (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.09-1.66). Conversely, enalapril had a relative renoprotective effect (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.13-1.53) compared with placebo (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.57-2.44) in patients with diabetes. A lower risk of renal impairment was seen in both groups with beta-blocker therapy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.57-0.85) and higher baseline ejection fraction (RR 0.93 per 5% increment, 95% CI 0.91-0. 96). CONCLUSIONS: Enalapril use caused a 33% increase in the risk of decreased renal function in patients with CHF. Diuretic use and advanced age increased this risk. Diabetes was associated with an increased risk of renal impairment in all patients with CHF, but this risk was reduced in the enalapril group compared with the placebo group. beta-Blocker therapy and higher ejection fraction were renoprotective in all patients regardless of therapy.",1,1,0,0

"The mapping of a cDNA from the human X-linked Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene to the mouse X chromosome. The recent discovery of sequences at the site of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) gene in humans has opened up the possibility of a detailed molecular analysis of the genes in humans and in related mammalian species . Until relatively recently , there was no obvious mouse model of this genetic disease for the development of therapeutic strategies . The identification of a mouse X-linked mutant showing muscular dystrophy , mdx , has provided a candidate mouse genetic homologue to the DMD locus ; the relatively mild pathological features of mdx suggest it may have more in common with mutations of the Becker muscular dystrophy type at the same human locus , however . But the close genetic linkage of mdx to G6PD and Hprt on the mouse X chromosome , coupled with its comparatively mild pathology , have suggested that the mdx mutation may instead correspond to Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy which itself is closely linked to DNA markers at Xq28-qter in the region of G6PD on the human X chromosome . Using an interspecific mouse domesticus / spretus cross , segregating for a variety of markers on the mouse X chromosome , we have positioned on the mouse X chromosome sequences homologous to a DMD cDNA clone . These sequences map provocatively close to the mdx mutation and unexpectedly distant from sparse fur , spf , the mouse homologue of OTC ( ornithine transcarbamylase ) which is closely linked to DMD on the human X chromosome . .",0,0,1,0

"Inhibition of sympathoadrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dogs. In six conscious, trained dogs, maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 mEq/kg/day, sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15-minute i.v. infusions of human alpha-atrial natriuretic factor. Mean arterial pressure (as a percentage of control +/- SEM) during randomized infusions of 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, or 1.0 microgram/kg/min was 99 +/- 1, 95 +/- 1 (p less than 0.05), 93 +/- 1 (p less than 0.01), or 79 +/- 6% (p less than 0.001), respectively, but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate (up to 0.3 microgram/kg/min) were observed, which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitroglycerin.

Given that at least 105 female meioses transmitting TCD have occurred since 1650 in these kindreds , extremely close linkage between TCD , DXYS1 and DXYS12 is suggested . The above haplotype is a very useful diagnostic tool in these TCD families . We suggest that our historical-genealogical approach to linkage analysis may be possible elsewhere in similar isolated populations",0,0,1,0

"Safety of transesophageal echocardiography in adults: study in a multidisciplinary hospital. BACKGROUND: TEE is a semi-invasive tool broadly used and its utilization associated to sedatives drugs might to affect the procedure safety. OBJECTIVE: to analyze aspects of TEE safety associated to the use of Midazolan (MZ) and Flumazenil (FL) and the influence of the clinical variables on the event rate. METHOD: prospective study with 137 patients that underwent TEE with MZ associated to moderate sedation. We analyzed the following events: complications related with the topical anesthesia, with MZ use and with the procedure. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to test the influence of the clinical variables: age, sex, stroke, myocardiopathy (MP), duration of the test, mitral regurgitation (MR) and the MZ dose. RESULTS: All patients (65+/-16 yrs; 58% males) finished the examination. The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg, respectively. The duration of the examination and the mean ejection fraction (EF) were 16.4+/-6.1 minutes and 60+/-9%, respectively. Mild hypoxia (SO2<90%) was the most common event (11 patients); 3 patients (2%) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 (5.8%) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use. Transient hypotension (SAP<90mmHg) occurred in 1 patient (0.7%). The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR, MP (EF<45%) and high doses of MZ (>5mg) were associated with events (p<0.001). The EF was 40%, in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group. CONCLUSION: TEE with sedation presents a low rate of events. There were no severe events and there was no need to interrupt the examinations.",1,0,0,0

"Water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortion. Four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline-induced abortions are described. The mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cases. Oxytocin administration during midtrimester-induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff, aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to watch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia, muscular irritability, or headaches. The oxytocin should be given only in Ringers lactate or, alternately, in Ringers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solutions. The urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decreases. The oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hours. If the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance.",0,0,1,0
"Effects of active constituents of Crocus sativus L., crocin on streptozocin-induced model of sporadic Alzheimer's disease in male rats. BACKGROUND: The involvement of water-soluble carotenoids, crocins, as the main and active components of Crocus sativus L. extract in learning and memory processes has been proposed. In the present study, the effect of crocins on sporadic Alzheimer's disease induced by intracerebroventricular (icv) streptozocin (STZ) in male rats was investigated. METHODS: Male adult Wistar rats (n = 90 and 260-290 g) were divided into 1, control; 2 and 3, crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg); 4, STZ; 5 and 6, STZ + crocins (15 and 30 mg/kg) groups. In Alzheimer's disease groups, rats were injected with STZ-icv bilaterally (3 mg/kg) in first day and 3 days later, a similar STZ-icv application was repeated. In STZ + crocin animal groups, crocin was applied in doses of 15 and 30 mg/kg, i.p., one day pre-surgery and continued for three weeks. Prescription of crocin in each dose was repeated once for two days. However, the learning and memory performance was assessed using passive avoidance paradigm, and for spatial cognition evaluation, Y-maze task was used. RESULTS: It was found out that crocin (30 mg/kg)-treated STZ-injected rats show higher correct choices and lower errors in Y-maze than vehicle-treated STZ-injected rats. In addition, crocin in the mentioned dose could significantly attenuated learning and memory impairment in treated STZ-injected group in passive avoidance test. CONCLUSION: Therefore, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of crocin (30 mg/kg) in antagonizing the cognitive deficits caused by STZ-icv in rats and its potential in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.",0,0,1,0
"Use of propranolol in the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypotension. Five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the study. They all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumbent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused norepinephrine. Treatment with propanolol administered intravenously (1-5 mg) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11/6 to 22/11 mmHg. Chronic oral administration of propranolol (40-160 mg/day) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20-35/15-25 mmg being observed. In 1 patient, marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdrawn. It otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were observed. Treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6-13 months with persistence of the pressor effect, although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time. Hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therapy. The studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension.",1,0,0,0

"Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine-induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells. Azidothymidine (AZT)-induced anemia in mice can be reversed by the administration of IGF-IL-3 (fusion protein of insulin-like growth factor II (IGF II) and interleukin 3). Although interleukin 3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin (EPO) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro, injection of IGF-IL-3 and EPO in AZT-treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF-IL-3 or EPO alone. We tested the hypothesis that the antagonistic effect of IL-3 and EPO on erythroid cells may be mediated by endothelial cells. Bovine liver erythroid cells were cultured on monolayers of human bone marrow endothelial cells previously treated with EPO and IGF-IL-3. There was a significant reduction of thymidine incorporation into both erythroid and endothelial cells in cultures pre-treated with IGF-IL-3 and EPO. Endothelial cell culture supernatants separated by ultrafiltration and ultracentrifugation from cells treated with EPO and IL-3 significantly reduced thymidine incorporation into erythroid cells as compared to identical fractions obtained from the media of cells cultured with EPO alone. These results suggest that endothelial cells treated simultaneously with EPO and IL-3 have a negative effect on erythroid cell production.",0,1,0,0
"Ifosfamide related encephalopathy: the need for a timely EEG evaluation. BACKGROUND: Ifosfamide is an alkylating agent useful in the treatment of a wide range of cancers including sarcomas, lymphoma, gynecologic and testicular cancers. Encephalopathy has been reported in 10-40% of patients receiving high-dose IV ifosfamide. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the role of electroencephalogram (EEG) in the early detection and management of ifosfamide related encephalopathy. METHODS: Retrospective chart review including clinical data and EEG recordings was done on five patients, admitted to MD Anderson Cancer Center between years 2009 and 2012, who developed ifosfamide related acute encephalopathy. RESULTS: All five patients experienced symptoms of encephalopathy soon after (within 12 h-2 days) receiving ifosfamide. Two patients developed generalized convulsions while one patient developed continuous non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) that required ICU admission and intubation. Initial EEG showed epileptiform discharges in three patients; run of triphasic waves in one patient and moderate degree diffuse generalized slowing. Mixed pattern with the presence of both sharps and triphasic waves were also noted. Repeat EEGs within 24_h of symptom onset showed marked improvement that was correlated with clinical improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Severity of ifosfamide related encephalopathy correlates with EEG changes. We suggest a timely EEG evaluation for patients receiving ifosfamide who develop features of encephalopathy.",0,0,1,1

"Does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition? A pilot study. This pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cognition. Patients participating in a randomised trial of anastrozole, tamoxifen alone or combined (ATAC) (n=94) and a group of women without breast cancer (n=35) completed a battery of neuropsychological measures. Compared with the control group, the patients were impaired on a processing speed task (p=0.032) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory (p=0.026) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both groups. Patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morbidity. The results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels, a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women. In view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly.",0,0,1,1

"A randomized comparison of labetalol and nitroprusside for induced hypotension. In a randomized study, labetalol-induced hypotension and nitroprusside-induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients (10 in each group) scheduled for major orthopedic procedures. Each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug-induced reductions in mean arterial blood pressure (BP) (50 to 55 mmHg). Nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in heart rate and cardiac output; rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitroprusside. Labetalol administration was not associated with any of these findings. Arterial PO2 decreased in both groups. It was concluded that labetalol offers advantages over nitroprusside.",1,0,0,0
"A novel animal model to evaluate the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the BBB. The purpose of this investigation was to explore the potentiality of a novel animal model to be used for the in vivo evaluation of the ability of a drug delivery system to promote the passage through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and/or to improve the brain localization of a bioactive compound. A Tween 80-coated poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles was used as a model of colloidal drug delivery system, able to trespass the BBB. Tacrine, administered in LiCl pre-treated rats, induces electrocorticographic seizures and delayed hippocampal damage. The toxic effects of tacrine-loaded poly-L-lactid acid nanoparticles (5mg/kg), a saline solution of tacrine (5mg/kg) and an empty colloidal nanoparticle suspension were compared following i.p. administration in LiCl-pre-treated Wistar rats. All the animals treated with tacrine-loaded nanoparticles showed an earlier outcome of CNS adverse symptoms, i.e. epileptic onset, with respect to those animals treated with the free compound (10 min vs. 22 min respectively). In addition, tacrine-loaded nanoparticles administration induced damage of neuronal cells in CA1 field of the hippocampus in all treated animals, while the saline solution of tacrine only in 60% of animals. Empty nanoparticles provided similar results to control (saline-treated) group of animals. In conclusion, the evaluation of time-to-onset of symptoms and the severity of neurodegenerative processes induced by the tacrine-lithium model of epilepsy in the rat, could be used to evaluate preliminarily the capability of a drug delivery system to trespass (or not) the BBB in vivo.",0,1,1,0
"Hydroxytyrosol ameliorates oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats with breast cancer. Oxidative stress is involved in several processes including cancer, aging and cardiovascular disease, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effect of drugs such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin causes significant cardiotoxicity characterized by marked increases in oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigate whether doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity can be ameliorated with the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol in rats with breast cancer. Thirty-six rats bearing breast tumors induced chemically were divided into 4 groups: control, hydroxytyrosol (0.5mg/kg, 5days/week), doxorubicin (1mg/kg/week), and doxorubicin plus hydroxytyrosol. Cardiac disturbances at the cellular and mitochondrial level, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV and apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress markers have been analyzed. Hydroxytyrosol improved the cardiac disturbances enhanced by doxorubicin by significantly reducing the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage. These results suggest that hydroxytyrosol improve the mitochondrial electron transport chain. This study demonstrates that hydroxytyrosol protect rat heart damage provoked by doxorubicin decreasing oxidative damage and mitochondrial alterations.",1,0,0,1

"Rhabdomyolysis and brain ischemic stroke in a heroin-dependent male under methadone maintenance therapy. OBJECTIVE: There are several complications associated with heroin abuse, some of which are life-threatening. Methadone may aggravate this problem. METHOD: A clinical case description. RESULTS: A 33-year-old man presented with rhabdomyolysis and cerebral ischemic stroke after intravenous heroin. He had used heroin since age 20, and had used 150 mg methadone daily for 6 months. He was found unconsciousness at home and was sent to our hospital. In the ER, his opiate level was 4497 ng/ml. In the ICU, we found rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and acute respiratory failure. After transfer to an internal ward, we noted aphasia and weakness of his left limbs. After MRI, we found cerebral ischemic infarction. CONCLUSION: Those using methadone and heroin simultaneously may increase risk of rhabdomyolysis and ischemic stroke. Patients under methadone maintenance therapy should be warned regarding these serious adverse events. Hypotheses of heroin-related rhabdomyolysis and stroke in heroin abusers are discussed.",0,1,1,0
"Mutations of the cathepsin C gene are responsible for Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. Papillon-Lefevre syndrome ( PLS ) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and severe early onset periodontitis that results in the premature loss of the primary and secondary dentitions . A major gene locus for PLS has been mapped to a 2 . 8 cM interval on chromosome 11q14 . Correlation of physical and genetic maps of this interval indicate it includes at least 40 ESTs and six known genes including the lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene ( CTSC ) . The CTSC message is expressed at high levels in a variety of immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes , macrophages , and their precursors . By RT-PCR , we found CTSC is also expressed in epithelial regions commonly affected by PLS , including the palms , soles , knees , and oral keratinised gingiva . The 4 . 7 kb CTSC gene consists of two exons . Sequence analysis of CTSC from subjects affected with PLS from five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations . An exon 1 nonsense mutation ( 856C-- > T ) introduces a premature stop codon at amino acid 286 . Three exon 2 mutations were identified , including a single nucleotide deletion ( 2692delA ) of codon 349 introducing a frameshift and premature termination codon , a 2 bp deletion ( 2673-2674delCT ) that results in introduction of a stop codon at amino acid 343 , and a G-- > A substitution in codon 429 ( 2931G-- > A ) introducing a premature termination codon . All PLS patients were homozygous for cathepsin C mutations inherited from a common ancestor . Parents and sibs heterozygous for cathepsin C mutations do not show either the palmoplantar hyperkeratosis or severe early onset periodontitis characteristic of PLS .

"Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-(PR3-ANCA) positive necrotizing glomerulonephritis after restarting sulphasalazine treatment. A 59-year-old woman with ulcerative colitis developed red eyes, pleural effusion, eosinophilia and urinary abnormalities after restarting of sulphasalazine treatment. Light microscopy of a kidney biopsy revealed segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis without deposition of immunoglobulin or complement. Proteinase 3-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (PR3-ANCA) titer was elevated at 183 ELISA units (EU) in sera (normal range less than 10 EU), myeloperoxidase-ANCA was negative. PR3-ANCA titer was 250 and 1,070 EU in pleural effusions on right and left side, respectively. Although cessation of sulphasalazine treatment resulted in improvements in fever, red eyes, chest pain, titer of C-reactive protein and volume of the pleural effusions, we initiated steroid therapy, because PR3-ANCA titer rose to 320 EU, eosinophil count increased to 1,100 cells/microl, and the pleural effusion remained. One month after steroid therapy, the pleural effusion disappeared, and PR3-ANCA titer normalized 3 months later.

"Genotype-phenotype correlations in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli. Germ-line mutations of the tumor suppressor APC are implicated in attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli ( AAPC ) , a variant of familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . AAPC is recognized by the occurrence of colonic adenomas and a later onset of colorectal cancer ( age > 40 years ) . The aim of this study was to assess genotype-phenotype correlations in AAPC families . By protein-truncation test ( PTT ) assay , the entire coding region of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds , and their phenotypic differences were examined . Five novel germ-line APC mutations were identified in seven kindreds . Mutations were located in three different regions of the APC gene  ( 1 ) at the 5 end spanning exons 4 and 5 , ( 2 ) within exon 9 , and ( 3 ) at the 3 distal end of the gene . Variability in the number of colorectal adenomas was most apparent in individuals with mutations in region 1 , and upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were more severe in them . In individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3 , the average number of adenomas tended to be lower than those in individuals with mutations in region 1 , although age at diagnosis was similar . In all AAPC kindreds , a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and rectal polyp sparing was observed . No desmoid tumors were found in these kindreds . Our data suggest that , in AAPC families , the location of the APC mutation may partially predict specific phenotypic expression .

"Ethambutol-associated optic neuropathy. INTRODUCTION: Ethambutol is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, which is still prevalent in Southeast Asia, and can be associated with permanent visual loss. We report 3 cases which presented with bitemporal hemianopia. CLINICAL PICTURE: Three patients with ethambutol-associated toxic optic neuropathy are described. All 3 patients had loss of central visual acuity, colour vision (Ishihara) and visual field. The visual field loss had a bitemporal flavour, suggesting involvement of the optic chiasm. TREATMENT: Despite stopping ethambutol on diagnosis, visual function continued to deteriorate for a few months. Subsequent improvement was mild in 2 cases. In the third case, visual acuity and colour vision normalised but the optic discs were pale. OUTCOME: All 3 patients had some permanent loss of visual function. CONCLUSIONS: Ethambutol usage is associated with permanent visual loss and should be avoided if possible or used with caution and proper ophthalmological follow-up. The author postulates that in cases of ethambutol associated chiasmopathy, ethambutol may initially affect the optic nerves and subsequently progress to involve the optic chiasm.",0,0,1,0
"Assessment of cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mice. The ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize DNA in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mice. Isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minipump implantation in adult C3Heb/FeJ mice resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight and a 19.3% increase in cardiomyocyte area. No DNA synthesis, as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes, was observed in control or hypertrophic hearts. A survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13% mononucleate, suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic background. To determine whether the capacity for reactive DNA synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation, cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number survey. These data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize DNA in response to isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy.",1,1,0,0

"Evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat. Male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin DSP4 (50 mg/kg) 7 days prior to injection of D-amphetamine (10 or 40 mumol/kg i.p.). The hyperactivity induced by D-amphetamine (10 mumol/kg) was significantly reduced by DSP4 pretreatment. However, the increased rearings and the amphetamine-induced stereotypies were not blocked by pretreatment with DSP4. The reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by DSP4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline-uptake blocking agent, desipramine, which prevents the neurotoxic action of DSP4. The present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat.",0,1,1,0

"Randomized, double-blind trial of mazindol in Duchenne dystrophy. There is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in Duchenne dystrophy. We conducted a 12-month controlled trial of mazindol, a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor, in 83 boys with Duchenne dystrophy. Muscle strength, contractures, functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline, and 6 and 12 months after treatment with mazindol (3 mg/d) or placebo. The study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25% of the expected rate of progression of weakness at P less than 0.05. Mazindol did not benefit strength at any point in the study. Side effects attributable to mazindol included decreased appetite (36%), dry mouth (10%), behavioral change (22%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (18%); mazindol dosage was reduced in 43% of patients. The effect of mazindol on GH secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the postabsorptive IGF-I levels obtained following 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in the mazindol treated to those in the placebo groups.

Peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times (once every 5 min) before ischemia (0 time) and 5, 15, and 30 min after ischemia. Plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides. During ischemia, a time-dependent increase of plasma oxypurines and nucleosides was observed. Plasma malondialdehyde, which was present in minimal amount at zero time (0.058 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.015), increased after 5 min of ischemia, resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion (0.298 mumol/liter plasma; SD 0.078). Increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model, one receiving 20 mg/kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetylsalicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia, the other receiving 650 micrograms/kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters/min intravenously during ischemia, although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly higher. The present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde, oxypurines, and nucleosides in peripheral blood, may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",0,0,1,0
"Pharmacological evidence for the potential of Daucus carota in the management of cognitive dysfunctions. The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Daucus carota seeds on cognitive functions, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. The ethanolic extract of Daucus carota seeds (DCE) was administered orally in three doses (100, 200, 400 mg/kg) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. DCE (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. The extent of memory improvement evoked by DCE was 23% at the dose of 200 mg/kg and 35% at the dose of 400 mg/kg in young mice using elevated plus maze. Similarly, significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mice. Furthermore, DCE reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Daucus carota extract (200, 400 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mice. The extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by DCE at the dose of 400 mg/kg was 22% in young and 19% in aged mice. There was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well, to the extent of 23% in young and 21% in aged animals with this dose of DCE. Therefore, DCE may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multifarious beneficial effects such as, memory improving property, cholesterol lowering property and anticholinesterase activity.",0,0,1,0
"Myoclonic, atonic, and absence seizures following institution of carbamazepine therapy in children. Five children, aged 3 to 11 years, treated with carbamazepine for epilepsy, had an acute aberrant reaction characterized by the onset of myoclonic, atypical absence and/or atonic (minor motor) seizures within a few days. When the carbamazepine was discontinued, two of the children returned to their former state very quickly, two had the minor motor seizures resolve in 3 and 6 months, and one had the seizures persist. The child in whom the seizures persisted was later found to have ceroid lipofuscinosis. The other children are doing well on other anticonvulsants.",0,0,1,0

"Ethambutol and optic neuropathy. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the association between ethambutol and optic neuropathy. METHOD: Thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with ethambutol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at Siriraj Hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively reviewed. The clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcome. RESULTS: All patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months (mean = 2.9 months) after starting ethambutol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg/kg/day (mean = 17 mg/kg/day). Seven (54%) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the drug. Of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment, 4 patients had diabetes mellitus, glaucoma and a history of heavy smoking. CONCLUSION: Early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with ethambutol therapy.

"Intelligence quotient profile in myotonic dystrophy, intergenerational deficit, and correlation with CTG amplification. An abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised ( WAIS-R ) was used to assess verbal and arithmetical cognitive performance in 55 subjects with myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) , covering all grades of disease severity , and 31 controls at 50 % risk of inheriting DM . Scaled scores from the assessment were converted into an intelligence quotient ( IQ ) estimation on each person . Significant IQ differences were found between  ( 1 ) all 55 DM subjects ( mean 90 . 2 , SD 16 . 1 ) and 31 controls ( 102 . 6 , SD 9 . 4 ) , with no sex differences in either group ; ( 2 ) 15 affected parents ( 99 . 3 , SD 12 . 2 ) and their affected children ( 88 . 1 , SD 17 . 2 ) , where significance was dependent on parental sex being female ; and ( 3 ) 15 pairs of affected sibs ( 89 . 6 , SD 13 . 2 ) and their normal sibs ( 100 . 2 , SD 7 . 6 ) . IQ steadily declined as ( 1 ) the age of onset of signs and symptoms decreased , and ( 2 ) the CTG expansion size increased . The correlation appeared to be more linear with age of onset . The correlation of IQ difference and CTG expansion difference in both the DM parent-child pairs and normal sib-affected sib pairs was poor , indicating that CTG expansion is not a reliable predictor of IQ either in individual persons or families .

"Cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenylpropanolamine in combination with caffeine. Phenylpropanolamine (PPA) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stroke. It is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and ""look-alike"" pills. In order to determine if PPA/caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and/or hypertensive rats, we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five days. Subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18% of the hypertensive rats. A single PPA/caffeine administration (same dose) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive animals. These results suggest that PPA/caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dosage. An acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor.",1,0,0,0
"Overgrowth of oral mucosa and facial skin, a novel feature of aspartylglucosaminuria. Aspartylglucosaminuria ( AGU ) is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency of aspartylglucosaminidase ( AGA ) . The main symptom is progressive mental retardation . A spectrum of different mutations has been reported in this disease , one missense mutation ( Cys163Ser ) being responsible for the majority of Finnish cases . We were able to examine 66 Finnish AGU patients for changes in the oral mucosa and 44 of these for changes in facial skin . Biopsy specimens of 16 oral lesions , 12 of them associated with the teeth , plus two facial lesions were studied histologically . Immunohistochemical staining for AGA was performed on 15 oral specimens . Skin was seborrhoeic in adolescent and adult patients , with erythema of the facial skin already common in childhood .

"Metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of Parkinson's disease. Metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Among the eight mGlu receptor subtypes, mGlu7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia, but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of PD is not known. The effects of N,N'-dibenzhydrylethane-1,2-diamine dihydrochloride (AMN082), the first selective allosteric activator of mGlu7 receptors, were thus tested in different rodent models of PD. Here, we show that oral (5 mg/kg) or intrastriatal administration (0.1 and 0.5 nmol) of AMN082 reverses haloperidol-induced catalepsy in rats. AMN082 (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) reduces apomorphine-induced rotations in unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. In a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major akinetic symptoms of PD patients, 5 mg/kg AMN082 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats. In addition, AMN082 reduces the duration of haloperidol-induced catalepsy in a mGlu7 receptor-dependent manner in wild-type but not mGlu7 receptor knockout mice. Higher doses of AMN082 (10 and 20 mg/kg p.o.) have no effect on the same models of PD. Overall these findings suggest that mGlu7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activity. Selective ligands of mGlu7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of antiparkinsonian therapeutic strategies.",0,0,1,0
"Antiarrhythmic effects of optical isomers of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias. Antiarrhythmic effects of (+)-cibenzoline and (-)-cibenzoline were examined using two canine ventricular arrhythmia models. Digitalis arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Na channel blockers, was induced by intermittent intravenous (i.v.) injection of ouabain in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs. Adrenaline arrhythmia, which is suppressed by Ca channel blockers, was induced by adrenaline infusion in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Ten and 5 mg/kg i.v. (+)-cibenzoline suppressed digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias, respectively. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (+)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmias were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). A lower dose of 1 mg/kg i.v. of (-)-cibenzoline suppressed the digitalis-induced arrhythmia, whereas 5 mg/kg i.v. was needed to suppress adrenaline-induced arrhythmias. The minimum effective plasma concentrations of (-)-cibenzoline for digitalis- and adrenaline-induced arrhythmia were 0.06 +/- 0.04 and 0.7 +/- 0.1 micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SD, n = 6). The stronger antiarrhythmic effect of (-)-cibenzoline indicates that (-)-isomer may have an effect nearly 5-20 times stronger in suppressing Na channels, but effects of both drugs on Ca channels may be almost equipotent.",1,1,1,0
"The association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery: a multivariate analysis in 11 529 patients. Because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery, we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 529 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from January 2004 to December 2010. A convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor movements. Multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seizures. A total of 100 (0.9%) patients developed postoperative convulsive seizures. Generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients, respectively. The median (IQR [range]) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 (6-12 [1-216]) h and 8 (6-11 [4-18]) h, respectively. Epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patients. Independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age, female sex, redo cardiac surgery, calcification of ascending aorta, congestive heart failure, deep hypothermic circulatory arrest, duration of aortic cross-clamp and tranexamic acid. When tested in a multivariate regression analysis, tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures (OR 14.3, 95% CI 5.5-36.7; p < 0.001). Patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in-hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seizures. Mean (IQR [range]) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 (49-228 [32-481]) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 (22-69 [14-1080]) h in patients without seizures (p < 0.001). Convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surgery. As tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor, its administration, particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg(-1), should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures.",1,0,1,0
"Neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2-chloroprocaine-CE, bupivacaine, and low pH normal saline in dogs.

"Nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in adult mice. BACKGROUND: Hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that nimodipine (NIMO) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin (NTG)-induced hypotension would preserve long-term associative memory. METHODS: The passive avoidance (PA) paradigm was used to assess memory retention. For PA training, latencies (seconds) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a Plexiglas tube where a shock was automatically delivered. Latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing trial. Ninety-six Swiss-Webster mice (30-35 g, 6-8 wk), were randomized into 6 groups 1) saline (control), 2) NTG immediately after learning, 3) NTG 3 h after learning, 4) NTG and NIMO, 5) vehicle, and 6) NIMO alone. The extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation (PbtO(2)) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of animals. RESULTS: All groups exhibited similar training latencies (17.0 +/- 4.6 s). Mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time (178 +/- 156 s) compared with those injected with saline, NTG + NIMO, or delayed NTG (580 +/- 81 s, 557 +/- 67 s, and 493 +/- 146 s, respectively). A Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups (H = 15.34; P < 0.001). In a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies, the same dose of NTG (n = 3) and NTG + NIMO (n = 3) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 85.9 +/- 3.8 mm Hg sem to 31.6 +/- 0.8 mm Hg sem and from 86.2 +/- 3.7 mm Hg sem to 32.6 +/- 0.2 mm Hg sem, respectively. Mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with NIMO alone decreased from 88.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg to 80.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg. The intergroup difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). PbtO(2) decreased from 51.7 +/- 4.5 mm Hg sem to 33.8 +/- 5.2 mm Hg sem in the NTG group and from 38.6 +/- 6.1 mm Hg sem to 25.4 +/- 2.0 mm Hg sem in the NTG + NIMO groups, respectively. There were no significant differences among groups. CONCLUSION: In a PA retention paradigm, the injection of NTG immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long-term associative memory in mice, whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effect. NIMO attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long-term memory caused by NTG but did not improve latency in the absence of hypotension. The observed effect of NIMO may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension, because there were no differences in the PbtO(2) indices among groups.",1,1,1,0
"Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine. In unanesthetized, spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine, 5 to 20 micrograms/kg, was inhibited or reversed by nalozone, 0.2 to 2 mg/kg. The hypotensive effect of 100 mg/kg alpha-methyldopa was also partially reversed by naloxone. Naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rate. In brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine, 10(-8) to 10(-5) M, did not influence stereoselective binding of [3H]-naloxone (8 nM), and naloxone, 10(-8) to 10(-4) M, did not influence clonidine-suppressible binding of [3H]-dihydroergocryptine (1 nM). These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors. As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site, the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha-methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone.",1,0,1,0

"Cardiac toxicity observed in association with high-dose cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer. INTRODUCTION: Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent given frequently as a component of many conditioning regimens. In high doses, its nonhematological dose-limiting toxicity is cardiomyopathy. STUDY DESIGN: We combined paclitaxel, melphalan and high-dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin in a triple sequential high-dose regimen for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Analysis was performed on 61 women with chemotherapy-responsive metastatic breast cancer receiving 96-h infusional cyclophosphamide as part of a triple sequential high-dose regimen to assess association between presence of peritransplant congestive heart failure (CHF) and the following pretreatment characteristics: presence of electrocardiogram (EKG) abnormalities, age, hypertension, prior cardiac history, smoking, diabetes mellitus, prior use of anthracyclines, and left-sided chest irradiation. RESULTS: Six of 61 women (10%) developed clinically reversible grade 3 CHF following infusional cyclophosphamide with a median percent decline in ejection fraction of 31%. Incidence of transient cyclophosphamide-related cardiac toxicity (10%) is comparable to previous recorded literature. Older age was significantly correlated with the CHF development; with median ages for the entire group and for patients developing CHF of 45 and 59, respectively. No association was found with other pretreatment characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of these findings, oncologists should carefully monitor fluid balance in older patients.

Chromosomal translocations in human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group ( HMG ) I-C DNA-binding domains and C-terminal sequences from different presumed transcription factors , suggesting a potential role for HMG I-C in the development of lipomas . To evaluate the role of the HMG I-C component , the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C have now been expressed in transgenic mice . Despite the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I-C protein , the transgenic mice develop a selective abundance of fat tissue early in life , show marked adipose tissue inflammation , and have an abnormally high incidence of lipomas . These findings demonstrate that the DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C , in the absence of a C-terminal fusion partner , are sufficient to perturb adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas . We provide data supporting the central utility of this animal model as a tool to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of one of the most common kind of human benign tumors . .",0,0,0,1

"Cholecystokinin-octapeptide restored morphine-induced hippocampal long-term potentiation impairment in rats. Cholecystokinin-octapeptide (CCK-8), which is a typical brain-gut peptide, exerts a wide range of biological activities on the central nervous system. We have previously reported that CCK-8 significantly alleviated morphine-induced amnesia and reversed spine density decreases in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in morphine-treated animals. Here, we investigated the effects of CCK-8 on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the lateral perforant path (LPP)-granule cell synapse of rat dentate gyrus (DG) in acute saline or morphine-treated rats. Population spikes (PS), which were evoked by stimulation of the LPP, were recorded in the DG region. Acute morphine (30mg/kg, s.c.) treatment significantly attenuated hippocampal LTP and CCK-8 (1ug, i.c.v.) restored the amplitude of PS that was attenuated by morphine injection. Furthermore, microinjection of CCK-8 (0.1 and 1ug, i.c.v.) also significantly augmented hippocampal LTP in saline-treated (1ml/kg, s.c.) rats. Pre-treatment of the CCK2 receptor antagonist L-365,260 (10ug, i.c.v) reversed the effects of CCK-8, but the CCK1 receptor antagonist L-364,718 (10ug, i.c.v) did not. The present results demonstrate that CCK-8 attenuates the effect of morphine on hippocampal LTP through CCK2 receptors and suggest an ameliorative function of CCK-8 on morphine-induced memory impairment.",0,0,1,0

"The effects of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions. The influence of sevoflurane on lidocaine-induced convulsions was studied in cats. The convulsive threshold (mean +/- SD) was 41.4 +/- 6.5 mg. l(-1) with lidocaine infusion (6 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)), increasing significantly to 66.6 +/- 10.9 mg. l(-1) when the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane was 0.8%. However, the threshold (61.6 +/- 8.7 mg. l(-1)) during 1.6% sevoflurane was not significant from that during 0.8% sevoflurane, indicating a celling effect. There was no significant difference in the convulsive threshold between sevoflurane and enflurane. The rise in blood pressure became less marked when higher concentrations of sevoflurane or enflurane were administered and the blood pressure at convulsions decreased significantly in 1.6% sevoflurane, and in 0.8% and 1.6% enflurane. However, there was no significant difference in the lidocaine concentrations measured when the systolic blood pressure became 70 mmHg. Apamin, a selective blocker of calcium-dependent potassium channels, was administered intracerebroventricularly in rats anesthetized with 0.8% sevoflurane to investigate the mechanism of the anticonvulsive effects. Apamin (10 ng) had a tendency to decrease the convulsive threshold (21.6 +/- 2.2 to 19.9 +/- 2.5 mg. l(-1)) but this was not statistically significant. It is suggested that sevoflurane reduces the convulsive effect of lidocaine toxicity but carries some risk due to circulatory depression.",1,0,0,0

"Low-molecular-weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart valves. BACKGROUND: The interruption of oral anticoagulant (OAC) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves, mainly before noncardiac surgery, non-surgical interventions, and pregnancy. Unfractionated heparin (UH) is currently the substitute for selected patients. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) offers theoretical advantages over UH, but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to UH in patients with prosthetic valves. HYPOTHESIS: The aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of LMWH in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practice. METHODS: For this paper, the current medical literature on LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively reviewed. RESULTS: There were eight series and six case reports. None of the studies was randomized, and only one was prospective. Data to establish the thromboembolic risk were incomplete. After excluding case reports, the following groups were constructed: (a) short-term administration, after valve insertion (n = 212); (b) short-term, perioperative (noncardiac)/periprocedural (n = 114); (c) long-term, due to intolerance to OAC (n = 16); (d) long-term, in pregnancy (n = 10). The incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9% for all the studies and 0.5, 0, 20, and 0% in groups a, b, c, and d, respectively; for hemorrhage, the overall rate was 3.4% (3.8, 2.6, 10, and 0% for the respective groups). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with mechanical heart valves, short-term LMWH therapy compares favorably with UH. Data on mid- and long-term LMWH administration in these patients are sparse. Further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of LMWH in patients with mechanical heart valves.",1,0,0,0

"Design and analysis of the HYPREN-trial: safety of enalapril and prazosin in the initial treatment phase of patients with congestive heart failure. Since the introduction of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors into the adjunctive treatment of patients with congestive heart failure, cases of severe hypotension, especially on the first day of treatment, have occasionally been reported. To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter, randomized, prazosin-controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment. Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin. Subjects were 1210 inpatients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II and III. Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension (5.2%) than the patients who received prazosin (12.9%). All patients recovered. It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is, therefore, unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients.",1,0,0,0
"Experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity: risk of concomitant chemotherapy. The role of cyclosporine (CSA) alone or in combination with various chemotherapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rats. Administration of 20 mg/kg/day CSA for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man. The combined administration of CSA and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential, such as gentamicin (at therapeutic doses), amphothericin B and ketoconazole, which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients, did not aggravate the CSA induced toxicity in the rat model. Gentamicin at toxic doses, however, increased CSA nephrotoxicity. Thus, the nephrotoxicity induced by CSA has a different pathogenetic mechanism.",0,1,0,0
"Anticonvulsant actions of MK-801 on the lithium-pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats. MK-801, a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models, coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone. Three major results are reported. First, pretreatment with MK-801 produced an effective and dose-dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium-pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone, suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models. Second, the anticonvulsant effect of MK-801 in the lithium-pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity. This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK-801 binding requires agonist-induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor. Third, although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine, it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures. Administration of MK-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine, i.e., during status epilepticus, gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate. These results suggest that activation of NMDA receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium-pilocarpine model. This was further supported by results showing that nonconvulsive doses of NMDA and pilocarpine were synergistic, resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality.",0,0,1,0

"Diuretics, potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary disease. It has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhythmias. If this were so, patients with coronary artery disease might be especially susceptible. Thus, myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium-conserving diuretic (amiloride) and a similar period on a potassium-losing diuretic (chlorthalidone) in a randomised study. Plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol/L lower during the chlorthalidone phase compared to amiloride therapy. Blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight, plasma renin and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations were similar on the 2 regimens. Compared to amiloride treatment, the chlorthalidone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats (24-hour Holter monitoring) and a higher Lown grading, increased upslope and duration of the monophasic action potential, prolonged ventricular effective refractory period, and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimulation. The above results indicate that because potassium-losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease, even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients.",1,1,0,0

"Thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity: a neurophysiological study. BACKGROUND: Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide. The study's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed. Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction > or =40% was the criteria for discontinuing therapy. RESULTS: During treatment, 11 patients showed a reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude compared to baseline values (9 with a reduction > or =50% and 2 <50%). One patient showed no changes in SAP amplitude. Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps. After thalidomide treatment, sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients. At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude, the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported. CONCLUSIONS: Sural nerve SAP amplitude reduction is a reliable and sensitive marker of degeneration and recovery of sensory fibres. This electrophysiological parameter provides information about subclinical neurotoxic potential of thalidomide but is not helpful in predicting the appearance of sensory symptoms.",0,0,1,0

Loss of consciousness occurred in 60-90 sec. Visual analogue scores (mean +/- SD) during induction were lower in Groups L (3.3 +/- 2.5) and T (4.1 +/- 2.7) than in Group C (5.6 +/- 2.3); P = 0.0031. The incidence of venous discomfort was lower in Group L (76.6%; P < 0.05) than in Group C (100%) but not different from Group T (90%). The VAS scores for recall of pain in the recovery room were correlated with the VAS scores during induction (r = 0.7045; P < 0.0001). Recovery room discharge times were similar: C (75.9 +/- 19.4 min); L 73.6 +/- 21.6 min); T (77.1 +/- 18.9 min). Assessing their overall satisfaction, 89.7% would choose propofol anaesthesia again. We conclude that lidocaine reduces the incidence and severity of propofol injection pain in ambulatory patients whereas thiopentone only reduces its severity.",0,0,1,0

"Dual effects of melatonin on barbiturate-induced narcosis in rats. Melatonin affects the circadian sleep/wake cycle, but it is not clear whether it may influence drug-induced narcosis. Sodium thiopenthal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre-treated with melatonin (0.05, 0.5, 5 and 50 mg/kg). Melatonin pre-treatment affected in a dual manner barbiturate narcosis, however, no dose-effect correlation was found. In particular, low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbiturate narcosis. In contrast, the highest dose of melatonin (50 mg/kg) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of narcosis, and a reduction in mortality rate. Melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg/kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ketamine- or diazepam-induced narcosis. Thus, the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological narcosis seems to be specific for the barbiturate mechanism of action.",0,0,1,0
"Genomic structure of the EWS gene and its relationship to EWSR1, a site of tumor-associated chromosome translocation. The EWS gene has been identified based on its location at the chromosome 22 breakpoint of the t ( 11 ; 22 ) ( q24 ; q12 ) translocation that characterizes Ewing sarcoma and related neuroectodermal tumors . The EWS gene spans about 40 kb of DNA and is encoded by 17 exons . The nucleotide sequence of the exons is identical to that of the previously described cDNA .

"Ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil-induced muscle rigidity. Systemic pretreatment with ketanserin, a relatively specific type-2 serotonin receptor antagonist, significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short-acting opiate agonist alfentanil. Following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal's left gastrocnemius muscle, rigidity was assessed by analyzing root-mean-square electromyographic activity. Intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg/kg prevented the alfentanil-induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with saline. Chlordiazepoxide at doses up to 10 mg/kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by alfentanil. Despite the absence of rigidity, animals that received ketanserin (greater than 0.31 mg/kg i.p.) followed by alfentanil were motionless, flaccid, and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil alone. Rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60-min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin alone. These results, in combination with previous work, suggest that muscle rigidity, a clinically relevant side-effect of parenteral narcotic administration, may be partly mediated via serotonergic pathways. Pretreatment with type-2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate-induced rigidity, although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced CNS, cardiovascular, and respiratory depression.",1,0,0,0

"Heart failure: to digitalise or not? The view against. Despite extensive clinical experience the role of digoxin is still not well defined. In patients with atrial fibrillation digoxin is beneficial for ventricular rate control. For patients in sinus rhythm and heart failure the situation is less clear. Digoxin has a narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and concentrations are affected by a number of drugs. Also, digoxin has undesirable effects such as increasing peripheral resistance and myocardial demands, and causing arrhythmias. There is a paucity of data from well-designed trials. The trials that are available are generally small with limitations in design and these show variation in patient benefit. More convincing evidence is required showing that digoxin improves symptoms or exercise capacity. Furthermore, no trial has had sufficient power to evaluate mortality. Pooled analysis of the effects of other inotropic drugs shows an excess mortality and there is a possibility that digoxin may increase mortality after myocardial infarction (MI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be used first as they are safer, do not require blood level monitoring, modify progression of disease, relieve symptoms, improve exercise tolerance and reduce mortality. Caution should be exercised in using digoxin until large mortality trials are completed showing either benefit or harm. Until then digoxin should be considered a third-line therapy.",1,0,1,0

The adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour-suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin . Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin . In colon carcinoma cells , loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) .

"Intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised children. BACKGROUND: Adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised host. The incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children, where case fatality rates as high as 50% to 80% have been reported. There are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease, nor are there any prospective randomized, controlled trials of potentially useful anti-adenovirus therapies. Apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small series. Experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and cidofovir. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, has broad antiviral activity against both RNA and DNA viruses, including documented activity against adenovirus in vitro. Ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection, and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis C. Intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever viruses. The most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild anemia. The use of cidofovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects, the most significant of which is nephrotoxicity. OBJECTIVE: We report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the literature. DESIGN/METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus disease. Two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants, respectively. The bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous cidofovir for progressive disseminated disease. An additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia; 2 were neonates, 1 of whom had partial DiGeorge syndrome. The remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transplant. Intravenous ribavirin was administered on a compassionate-use protocol. RESULTS: Complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children: the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumonia. The remaining 3 children died of adenovirus disease. Intravenous ribavirin therapy was well tolerated. Use of cidofovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutropenia. DISCUSSION: Our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease, namely solid-organ and bone marrow transplant recipients, neonates, and children with immunodeficiency. Although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature, therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infection. Early identification, eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic response. CONCLUSIONS: Two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin recovered. The availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction, may make earlier, more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possible. Given the seriousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts, especially children, a large, multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti-adenoviral therapies, such as intravenous ribavirin, is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy.",0,1,0,0

Prenatal cocaine exposure and cranial sonographic findings in preterm infants. PURPOSE: Prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with subependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at term. We sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of subependymal cysts in preterm infants. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial sonograms obtained during a 1-year period on 122 premature (< 36 weeks of gestation) infants. Infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups: those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to cocaine. Infants were assigned to the cocaine-exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of delivery. RESULTS: Five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug histories. The incidence of subependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14% (16 of 117). The incidence of subependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44% (8 of 18) compared with 8% (8 of 99) in the unexposed group (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We found an increased incidence of subependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine prenatally. This result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants.,0,1,1,0

"Delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mouse. The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice (DBA/2) but not in a resistant strain (C57BL/6) when both were treated with a single 300 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide (CY). Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with CY, and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures, and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy. Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7-10 days. After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non-ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of DBA/2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL/6 mice. Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium. Mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in DBA/2 mice than in C57BL/6 mice or untreated controls. Electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical discoidal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cells. Instead, numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial layers. Delayed cystitis still persisted in DBA/2 mice 100 days after treatment. These results indicate that delayed toxicity of CY in female DBA/2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in C57BL/6 mice. This pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease.",0,0,1,0

"Age and renal clearance of cimetidine. In 35 patients (ages 20 to 86 yr) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high-pressure liquid chromatography and for creatinine. Cimetidine clearance decreased with age. The extrapolated 6-hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose, after intravenous cimetidine, increased with age of the patients. The ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance (Rc) averaged 4.8 +/- 2.0, indicating net tubular secretion for cimetidine. Rc seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine, suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process. There was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine (with a drug level of 1.9 microgram/ml 6 hr after a dose) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram/ml.

"Genetic mapping of the copper toxicosis locus in Bedlington terriers to dog chromosome 10, in a region syntenic to human chromosome region 2p13-p16. Abnormal hepatic copper accumulation is recognized as an inherited disorder in man , mouse , rat and dog .

"Etiology of hypercalcemia in hemodialysis patients on calcium carbonate therapy. Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients (36%) became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder. In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia, indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age, sex, length of time on dialysis, and etiology of renal disease. In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 2.7 to 3.8 mmol/L (10.7 to 15.0 mg/dL), patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch, compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch (2.4 +/- 0.03 to 2.5 +/- 0.03 mmol/L [9.7 +/- 0.2 to 10.2 +/- 0.1 mg/dL], P = 0.006).

"Oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage in adriamycin-induced cardiac mitochondrial injury. The purpose of the present study was to determine if elevated reactive oxygen (ROS)/nitrogen species (RNS) reported to be present in adriamycin (ADR)-induced cardiotoxicity actually resulted in cardiomyocyte oxidative/nitrative damage, and to quantitatively determine the time course and subcellular localization of these postulated damage products using an in vivo approach. B6C3 mice were treated with a single dose of 20 mg/kg ADR. Ultrastructural damage and levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4HNE)-protein adducts and 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) were analyzed. Quantitative ultrastructural damage using computerized image techniques showed cardiomyocyte injury as early as 3 hours, with mitochondria being the most extensively and progressively injured subcellular organelle. Analysis of 4HNE protein adducts by immunogold electron microscopy showed appearance of 4HNE protein adducts in mitochondria as early as 3 hours, with a peak at 6 hours and subsequent decline at 24 hours. 3NT levels were significantly increased in all subcellular compartments at 6 hours and subsequently declined at 24 hours. Our data showed ADR induced 4HNE-protein adducts in mitochondria at the same time point as when mitochondrial injury initially appeared. These results document for the first time in vivo that mitochondrial oxidative damage precedes nitrative damage. The progressive nature of mitochondrial injury suggests that mitochondria, not other subcellular organelles, are the major site of intracellular injury.",1,0,0,0

"Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats: involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress, and prevention by topiramate. Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced-behaviour is poorly understood. Nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms. Therefore NFkappaB activity, oxidative stress, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity, spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate, a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction, were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats. NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats, as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus, whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased. Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex. In contrast, learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase. These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine. Topiramate prevented all the alterations observed, showing novel neuroprotective properties.",0,0,1,0

"Down-regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local-anesthetics-induced convulsions and the counteraction by co-administration with local anesthetics. Alterations of norepinephrine transporter (NET) function by chronic inhibition of NET in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mice. Daily administration of desipramine, an inhibitor of the NET, for 5 days decreased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake in the P2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex, striatum or amygdalae. Co-administration of lidocaine, bupivacaine or tricaine with desipramine reversed this effect. Daily treatment of cocaine increased [(3)H]norepinephrine uptake into the hippocampus. Daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine-induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine-induced convulsions. Co-administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desipramine. These results suggest that down-regulation of hippocampal NET induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine convulsions. Inhibition of Na(+) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine-induced down-regulation of NET function. Repeated administration of cocaine induces up-regulation of hippocampal NET function. Desipramine-induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine.",0,0,1,0

"Inactivation of germline mutant APC alleles by attenuated somatic mutations: a molecular genetic mechanism for attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. Germline mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumor-suppressor gene result in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) . Patients with FAP typically develop hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer . A subset of germline APC mutations results in an attenuated FAP ( AFAP ) phenotype , in which patients develop fewer tumors and develop them at an older age . Although a genotype-phenotype correlation between the locations of APC germline mutations and the development of AFAP has been well documented , the mechanism for AFAP has not been well defined . We investigated the mechanism for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele ( APC ( AS9 ) ) that has a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9 . APC ( AS9 ) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription , the major tumor-suppressor function of APC , as did the wild-type APC . Mutation analysis showed that both APC ( AS9 ) and the wild-type APC alleles were somatically mutated in most colorectal tumors from these patients . Functional analysis showed that 4666insA , a common somatic mutation in APC ( AS9 ) in these tumors , did not inactivate the wild-type APC . Our results indicate that carriers of APC ( AS9 ) develop fewer colorectal tumors than do typical patients with FAP because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is necessary for colorectal tumorigenesis . However , these patients develop colorectal tumors more frequently than does the general population because APC ( AS9 ) is inactivated by mutations that do not inactivate the wild-type APC . .",0,0,0,1
"Differential effects of 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers: therapeutic implications. Increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic modalities. Clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selectivity. In contrast to verapamil and diltiazem, which are roughly equipotent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissue. As the first dihydropyridine available for use in the United States, nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function. Additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therapy. Once or twice daily dosage possible with nitrendipine and nisoldipine offers a convenient administration schedule, which encourages patient compliance in long-term therapy of hypertension. The coronary vasodilating properties of nisoldipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in angina. Selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage, migraine headache, dementia, and stroke. In general, the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated, with headache, facial flushing, palpitations, edema, nausea, anorexia, and dizziness being the more common adverse effects.",1,0,1,0

"X-linked spastic paraplegia and Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease are allelic disorders at the proteolipid protein locus. Three forms of X-linked spastic paraplegia ( SPG ) have been defined . One locus ( SPG 1 ) maps to Xq28 while two clinically distinct forms map to Xq22 ( SPG2 ) . A rare X-linked dysmyelinating disorder of the central nervous system , Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) , has also been mapped to Xq21-q22 , and is caused by mutations in the proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) which encodes two myelin proteins , PLP and DM20 . While narrowing the genetic interval containing SPG2 in a large pedigree , we found that PLP was the closest marker to the disease locus , implicating PLP as a possible candidate gene . We have found that a point mutation ( His139Tyr ) in exon 3B of an affected male produces a mutant PLP but a normal DM20 , and segregates with the disease ( Zmax = 6 . 63 , theta = 0 . 00 ) . It appears , therefore , that SPG2 and PMD are allelic disorders",0,0,1,0
"Massive proteinuria and acute renal failure after oral bisphosphonate (alendronate) administration in a patient with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. A 61-year-old Japanese man with nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was initially responding well to steroid therapy. The amount of daily urinary protein decreased from 15.6 to 2.8 g. Within 14 days of the oral bisphosphonate (alendronate sodium) administration, the amount of daily urinary protein increased rapidly up to 12.8 g with acute renal failure. After discontinuing the oral alendronate, the patient underwent six cycles of hemodialysis and four cycles of LDL apheresis. Urinary volume and serum creatinine levels recovered to the normal range, with urinary protein disappearing completely within 40 days. This report demonstrates that not only intravenous, but also oral bisphosphonates can aggravate proteinuria and acute renal failure.",0,1,0,0
"Elevation of ADAM10, ADAM17, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression with media degeneration features CaCl2-induced thoracic aortic aneurysm in a rat model. PURPOSE: This study was designed to establish a rat model of thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) by calcium chloride (CaCl(2))-induced arterial injury and to explore the potential role of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (TIMPs) in TAA formation. METHODS: Thoracic aorta of male Sprague-Dawley rats was exposed to 0.5M CaCl(2) or normal saline (NaCl). After 12weeks, animals were euthanized, and CaCl(2)-treated, CaCl(2)-untreated (n=12) and NaCl-treated aortic segments (n=12) were collected for histological and molecular assessments. MMP-TIMP and ADAM mRNAs were semi-quantitatively analyzed and protein expressions were determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Despite similar external diameters among CaCl(2)-treated, non-CaCl(2)-treated and NaCl-treated segments, aneurymal alteration (n=6, 50%), media degeneration with regional disruption, fragmentation of elastic fiber, and increased collagen deposition (n=12, 100%) were demonstrated in CaCl(2)-treated segments. MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 mRNA levels were increased in CaCl(2)-treated segments (all p<0.01), with trends of elevation in CaCl(2)-untreated segments, as compared with NaCl-treated segments. Immunohistochemistry displayed significantly increased expressions of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (all p<0.01) in intima and media for CaCl(2)-treated segments. TIMP mRNA and tissue levels did not differ obviously among the three aortic segments. CONCLUSION: This study establishes a TAA model by periarterial CaCl(2) exposure in rats, and demonstrates a significant elevation of expression of MMP-2, MMP-9, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the pathogenesis of vascular remodeling.",1,0,0,0
"The carrier frequency of the BRCA1 185delAG mutation is approximately 1 percent in Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Since BRCA1 , the first major gene responsible for inherited breast cancer , was cloned , more than 50 unique mutations have been detected in the germline of individuals with breast and ovarian cancer . In high-risk pedigrees , female carriers of BRCA1 mutations have an 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer , and a 40-50 % risk of ovarian cancer . However , the mutation stats of individuals unselected for breast or ovarian cancer has not been determined , and it is not known whether mutations in such individuals confer the same risk of cancer as in individuals from the high-risk families studied so far . Following the finding of a 185delAG frameshift mutation in several Ashkenazi Jewish breast / ovarian families , we have determined the frequency of this mutation in 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer , and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin . We observed the 185delAG mutation in 0 . 9 % of Ashkenazim ( 95 % confidence limit , 0 . 4-1 . 8 % ) and in none of the reference samples .

"A dystonia-like syndrome after neuropeptide (MSH/ACTH) stimulation of the rat locus ceruleus. The movement disorder investigated in these studies has some features in common with human idiopathic dystonia, and information obtained in these studies may be of potential clinical benefit. The present experimental results indicated that peptidergic stimulation of the LC resulted in a NE-mediated inhibition of cerebellar Purkinje cells located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway. However, it is not certain as to the following: (a) what receptors were stimulated by the ACTH N-terminal fragments at the LC that resulted in this disorder; (b) whether NE, released onto Purkinje cell synapses located at terminals of the ceruleo-cerebellar pathway, did indeed cause the long-term depression at Purkinje cell synapses (previously described by others) that resulted in the long duration of the movement disorder; (c) whether the inhibition of inhibitory Purkinje cells resulted in disinhibition or increased excitability of the unilateral cerebellar fastigial or interpositus nuclei, the output targets of the Purkinje cell axons, that may have been an important contributing factor to this disorder.

"Genotype and phenotype in patients with dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency . Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) deficiency is an autosomal recessive disease characterised by thymine-uraciluria in homozygous deficient patients and has been associated with a variable clinical phenotype . In order to understand the genetic and phenotypic basis for DPD deficiency , we have reviewed 17 families presenting 22 patients with complete deficiency of DPD .

"Irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in F344 rats. Renal papillary necrosis (RPN) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long-term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female Fischer 344 rats. Renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks, when no analgesics were given, to investigate whether the analgesic-induced changes were reversible. There was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix, or proliferation of remaining undamaged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treatment. The recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural damage. During the early stages of analgesic treatment, the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible, but after prolonged analgesic treatment, maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover. This study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in Fischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to RPN. The associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla.",0,1,0,0

"Risk for valvular heart disease among users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medication. BACKGROUND: Because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30% to 38% of users of fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine had valvular disease, these drugs were withdrawn from the market. OBJECTIVE: To determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medications. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: Academic primary care practices. PATIENTS: 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therapy.

"Evidence of functional somatotopy in GPi from results of pallidotomy. The objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) by studying the effects of unilateral pallidotomy on parkinsonian 'off' signs and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID). We found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests (Core Assessment Program for Intracerebral Transplantations) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery, whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in LID. We also found a highly significant correlation (P: < 0.0001, r = 0.8) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the GPi and the improvement in LID in the contralateral limbs, whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian 'off' signs. The volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dyskinesias or parkinsonian 'off' signs. The differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian 'off' signs and LID and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dyskinesias and parkinsonian 'off' signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian 'off' signs and dyskinesias. Whereas cells in a wider area of the GPi may be implicated in parkinsonism, the ventral GPi seems to be crucial for the manifestation of LID. We suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somatotopy of the systems within the GPi that mediate parkinsonism and dyskinesias, especially along the dorsoventral trajectory used in pallidotomy. The outcome of pallidotomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal GPi could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms, and hence could be variable.",0,0,1,0
"Experimental progressive muscular dystrophy and its treatment with high doses anabolizing agents. We are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man. Noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field; a recessive autosomic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view. Myopathy due to lack of vitamin E and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form. The authors induced myodystrophy in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in vitamin E. The pharmacological characteristics of vitamin E and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency, especially in the muscles, are illustrated. It is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of myopathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extraordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the Orthopaedic Traumatological Centre, Florence. The encouraging results obtained in various authoratative departments in myopathic patients by using anabolizing steroids have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one anabolizing agent (Dianabol, CIBA) at high doses in rats rendered myopathic by a diet deficient in vitamin E. In this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight (increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of anabolizing agent), but most of all they found histological changes due to ""regenerative"" changes in the muscle tissue, which however maintained its myopathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the anabolizing agent. The authors conclude by affirming the undoubted efficacy of the anabolizing steroids in experimental myopathic disease, but they have reservations as to the transfer of the results into the human field, where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on virility; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis-a-vis the ""regeneration"" of the muscle tissue; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin E but something as yet unknown.",0,0,1,0
"Carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat. BACKGROUND: The most striking of carboplatin's advantages (CBDCA) over cisplatin (CDDP) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effects. However, the use of CBDCA higher-intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in polychemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system damage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two different schedules of CBDCA administration (10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg i.p. twice a week for nine times) were evaluated in Wistar rats. Neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral (tail-flick test), neurophysiological (nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve), morphological, morphometrical and analytical effects. RESULTS: CBDCA administration induced dose-dependent peripheral neurotoxicity. Pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired, particularly after the high-dose treatment. The dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and, to a lesser extent, satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by CDDP, mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neurons. Moreover, significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after CBDCA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CBDCA is neurotoxic in our model, and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by CDDP that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanism. This model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of CBDCA on the peripheral nervous system.",0,1,1,0

"Comparison of laryngeal mask with endotracheal tube for anesthesia in endoscopic sinus surgery. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare surgical conditions, including the amount of intraoperative bleeding as well as intraoperative blood pressure, during functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) using flexible reinforced laryngeal mask airway (FRLMA) versus endotracheal tube (ETT) in maintaining controlled hypotension anesthesia induced by propofol-remifentanil total i.v. anesthesia (TIVA). METHODS: Sixty normotensive American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II adult patients undergoing FESS under controlled hypotension anesthesia caused by propofol-remifentanil-TIVA were randomly assigned into two groups: group I, FRLMA; group II, ETT. Hemorrhage was measured and the visibility of the operative field was evaluated according to a six-point scale. RESULTS: Controlled hypotension was achieved within a shorter period using laryngeal mask using lower rates of remifentanil infusion and lower total dose of remifentanil. CONCLUSION: In summary, our results indicate that airway management using FRLMA during controlled hypotension anesthesia provided better surgical conditions in terms of quality of operative field and blood loss and allowed for convenient induced hypotension with low doses of remifentanil during TIVA in patients undergoing FESS.",1,0,1,0
"Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for Parkinson's disease. High frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced Parkinson's disease. AIM: We studied the effect of high frequency STN stimulation in 23 patients. METHOD: Twenty-three patients suffering from severe Parkinson's disease (Stages III-V on Hoehn and Yahr scale) and, particularly bradykinesia, rigidity, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the STN. Preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months follow-up, in ""on"" and ""off"" drug conditions, was carried out using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Hoehn and Yahr staging, England activities of daily living score and video recordings. RESULTS: After one year of electrical stimulation of the STN, the patients' scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale parts II and III) off medication improved by 62% and 61% respectively (p<0.0005). The subscores for the akinesia, rigidity, tremor and gait also improved. (p<0.0005). The average levodopa dose decreased from 813 mg to 359 mg. The cognitive functions remained unchanged. Two patients developed device-related complications and two patients experienced abnormal weight gain. CONCLUSION: Bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation is an effective treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. It reduces the severity of ""off"" phase symptoms, improves the axial symptoms and reduces levodopa requirements. The reduction in the levodopa dose is useful in controlling drug-induced dyskinesias.",0,0,1,0

"Acute bronchodilating effects of ipratropium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipratropium bromide aerosol (36 micrograms) and short-acting theophylline tablets (dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10-20 micrograms/mL) were compared in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15% increase in the FEV1 (responders) were 31% and 90%, respectively, for ipratropium and 17% and 50%, respectively, for theophylline. The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline. The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipratropium and 2.4 hours with theophylline. While side effects were rare, those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. These results show that ipratropium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction.",1,0,1,0

"Respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilepsy. PURPOSE: Apnea is known to occur during seizures, but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are few. Data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarce. Here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. METHODS: Twelve rats (six chronically epileptic animals and six controls) were anesthetized, given tracheotomies, and subjected to hyperventilation or hypoventilation conditions. Breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tidally through a pneumotachograph. This flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer, passed through a polygraph, and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation (VE), tidal volume (VT), inspiratory time (TI), expiratory time (TE), breathing frequency (f), and mean inspiratory flow (VT/TI) on a breath-by-breath basis. RESULTS: The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine-treated and control rats. Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups, in the epileptic group, the decrease in VE was due to a significant (p < 0.05) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals. The hypoventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial Paco2, followed by an increase in VE. In the epileptic group, the increase in VE was mediated by a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in TE peak compared with the control group. Systemic application of KCN, to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemoreception activation on ventilation, led to a similar increase in VE for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that pilocarpine-treated animals have an altered ability to react to (or compensate for) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determined. We speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy-associated conditions.",0,0,1,0
"Vinorelbine-related cardiac events: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine (VNR) have been reported in the literature. In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing VNR with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies. Randomized clinical trials comparing VNR with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in Medline, Embase, Evidence-based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002. Outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events, toxic deaths and cardiac event-related deaths reported in each publication. We found 19 trials, involving 2441 patients treated by VNR and 2050 control patients. The incidence of cardiac events with VNR was 1.19% [95% confidence interval (CI) (0.75; 1.67)]. There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between VNR and other drugs [odds ratio: 0.92, 95% CI (0.54; 1.55)]. The risk of VNR cardiac events was similar to vindesine (VDS) and other cardiotoxic drugs [fluorouracil, anthracyclines, gemcitabine (GEM) em leader ]. Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases, the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history, and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre-existing cardiac diseases. Vinorelbine-related cardiac events concern about 1% of treated patients in clinical trials. However, the risk associated with VNR seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications.",1,0,1,1

"Constitutive and regulated modes of splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) isoforms with distinct properties. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is the most prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease in adults . The genetic defect is a CTG triplet repeat expansion in the 3-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase ( DMPK ) gene , consisting of 15 exons . Using a transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model , we demonstrate here that the endogenous mouse DMPK gene and the human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs which have almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies and expression patterns . Use of a cryptic 5 splice site in exon 8 , which results in absence or presence of 15 nucleotides specifying a VSGGG peptide motif , and / or use of a cryptic 3 splice site in exon 14 , which leads to a frameshift in the mRNA reading frame , occur as independent stochastic events in all tissues examined . In contrast , the excision of exons 13 / 14 that causes a frameshift and creates a C-terminally truncated protein is clearly cell type dependent and occurs predominantly in smooth muscle . We generated all six full-length mouse cDNAs that result from combinations of these three major splicing events and show that their transfection into cells in culture leads to production of four different approximately 74 kDa full-length ( heart- , skeletal muscle- or brain-specific ) and two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa ( smooth muscle-specific ) isoforms .

"Epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpretation. Three cases of EEG changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are reported. In one patient, enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seizures. Until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified, the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvulsants. Two other patients suffered from partial, complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medication. Epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure-free. Previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mistakes in clinical interpretation of the EEG. On the other hand, enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during corticography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings.",0,0,1,0

"Preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an American formulation of adenosine in humans. BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans, and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a Swedish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimulation. The purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the US, using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin-evoked mechanical hypersensitivity. METHODS: Following Food and Drug Administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent, 65 volunteers were studied in two trials: an open-label, dose-escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25-2.0 mg and a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adenosine, 2 mg. Cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis, and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determined. RESULTS: Adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h. In contrast, residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short (< 4 h). CONCLUSIONS: These results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity, presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injection. The long-lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid.",0,0,1,0

"An integrated characterization of serological, pathological, and functional events in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. Many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity, yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage, which would allow monitoring and intervention, are lacking. In this study, we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, applying multiple approaches, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the timecourse of serological, pathological, and functional events underlying this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off-dosing ""recovery"" period. Electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dose. Histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration, hypertrophy/cytomegaly, and extensive vacuolation after two doses. Extensive replacement fibrosis (quantified by Sirius red staining) developed during the off-dosing period. Functional indices assessed by cardiac MRI (including left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output, and E/A ratio) declined progressively, reaching statistical significance after two doses and culminating in ""clinical"" LV dysfunction by 12 weeks. Significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin I (cTnI) emerged after eight doses, importantly preceding the LVEF decline to <50%. Troponin I levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement, histopathological grading, and diastolic dysfunction. In summary, subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker, followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifestations. Myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in cTnI occurred later. However, all indices predated ""clinical"" LV dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers.",1,0,0,1

"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias are improved by fluoxetine. We evaluated the severity of motor disability and dyskinesias in seven levodopa-responsive patients with Parkinson's disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist, apomorphine, before and after the administration of fluoxetine (20 mg twice per day) for 11 +/- 1 days. After fluoxetine treatment, there was a significant 47% improvement (p < 0.05) of apomorphine-induced dyskinesias without modification of parkinsonian motor disability. The dyskinesias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dystonic dyskinesias (onset- and end-of-dose dyskinesias) and in the upper limbs during choreic mid-dose dyskinesias. The results suggest that increased brain serotoninergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce levodopa- or dopamine agonist-induced dyskinesias without aggravating parkinsonian motor disability.",0,0,1,0
"The protective role of Nrf2 in streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. OBJECTIVE: Diabetic nephropathy is one of the major causes of renal failure, which is accompanied by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Nrf2 is the primary transcription factor that controls the antioxidant response essential for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. Here, we report our findings demonstrating a protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We explore the protective role of Nrf2 against diabetic nephropathy using human kidney biopsy tissues from diabetic nephropathy patients, a streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy model in Nrf2(-/-) mice, and cultured human mesangial cells. RESULTS: The glomeruli of human diabetic nephropathy patients were under oxidative stress and had elevated Nrf2 levels. In the animal study, Nrf2 was demonstrated to be crucial in ameliorating streptozotocin-induced renal damage. This is evident by Nrf2(-/-) mice having higher ROS production and suffering from greater oxidative DNA damage and renal injury compared with Nrf2(+/+) mice. Mechanistic studies in both in vivo and in vitro systems showed that the Nrf2-mediated protection against diabetic nephropathy is, at least, partially through inhibition of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and reduction of extracellular matrix production. In human renal mesangial cells, high glucose induced ROS production and activated expression of Nrf2 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, activation or overexpression of Nrf2 inhibited the promoter activity of TGF-beta1 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas knockdown of Nrf2 by siRNA enhanced TGF-beta1 transcription and fibronectin production. CONCLUSIONS: This work clearly indicates a protective role of Nrf2 in diabetic nephropathy, suggesting that dietary or therapeutic activation of Nrf2 could be used as a strategy to prevent or slow down the progression of diabetic nephropathy.",0,1,1,0

"Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels. Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors. Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects; features shared by so-called 'atypical' neuroleptics. To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects, we used [123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone (n = 12) or haloperidol (n = 7). Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses. There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone. Drug-induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone (42%) and haloperidol (29%) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60%. Based on these observations, it is concluded that 5-HT2 blockade obtained with risperidone at D2 occupancy rates of 60% and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects.",0,0,1,0
"Antibacterial medication use during pregnancy and risk of birth defects: National Birth Defects Prevention Study.

MAIN EXPOSURE: Reported maternal use of antibacterials (1 month before pregnancy through the end of the first trimester). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Odds ratios (ORs) measuring the association between antibacterial use and selected birth defects adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The reported use of antibacterials increased during pregnancy, peaking during the third month. Sulfonamides were associated with anencephaly (adjusted OR [AOR] = 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-8.8), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 3.2; 95% CI, 1.3-7.6), coarctation of the aorta (AOR = 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.6), choanal atresia (AOR = 8.0; 95% CI, 2.7-23.5), transverse limb deficiency (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI, 1.0-5.9), and diaphragmatic hernia (AOR = 2.4; 95% CI, 1.1-5.4). Nitrofurantoins were associated with anophthalmia or microphthalmos (AOR = 3.7; 95% CI, 1.1-12.2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (AOR = 4.2; 95% CI, 1.9-9.1), atrial septal defects (AOR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4), and cleft lip with cleft palate (AOR = 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.9).

"Doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity monitored by ECG in freely moving mice. A new model to test potential protectors. In laboratory animals, histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. However, for monitoring during treatment, large numbers of animals are needed. Recently we developed a new method to measure ECG values in freely moving mice by telemetry. With this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ECG of freely moving BALB/c mice and the efficacy of ICRF-187 as a protective agent. The ST interval significantly widened from 15.0 +/- 1.5 to 56.8 +/- 11.8 ms in week 10 (7 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation). The ECG of the control animals did not change during the entire study. After sacrifice the hearts of doxorubicin-treated animals were enlarged and the atria were hypertrophic. As this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents, the protection of ICRF-187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity (6 weekly doses of 4 mg/kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation). On this schedule, the animals' hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ICRF-187 (50 mg/kg given i.p. 1 h before doxorubicin) provided almost full protection. These data were confirmed by histology. The results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time. These findings result in a model that allows the testing of protectors against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by ICRF-187.",1,0,1,0
"Cerebral vasculitis following oral methylphenidate intake in an adult: a case report. Methylphenidate is structurally and functionally similar to amphetamine.

We report the case of a 63-year-old female who was treated with methylphenidate due to hyperactivity and suffered from multiple ischaemic strokes. We consider drug-induced cerebral vasculitis as the most likely cause of recurrent ischaemic strokes in the absence of any pathological findings during the diagnostic work-up. We conclude that methylphenidate mediated vasculitis should be considered in patients with neurological symptoms and a history of methylphenidate therapy. This potential side-effect, though very rare, represents one more reason to be very restrictive in the use of methylphenidate.",0,0,1,0

"D-penicillamine-induced angiopathy in rats. The effect of high dose D-penicillamine treatment on aortic permeability to albumin and on the ultrastructure of the vessel. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with D-penicillamine (D-pen) 500 mg/kg/day for 10 or 42 days. Pair fed rats served as controls. Changes in aortic morphology were examined by light- and transmission-electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, the endothelial permeability and the penetration through the aortic wall of albumin were studied 10 minutes, 24 and 48 hours after i. v. injection of human serum 131I-albumin (131I-HSA). TEM revealed extensive elastolysis in the arterial wall of D-pen-treated rats, consistent with an inhibitory effect on crosslink formation. In experimental animals excess deposition of collagen and glycoaminoglycans was observed in the subendothelial and medial layer of the aortic wall, together with prominent basal membrane substance around aortic smooth muscle cells. The aorta/serum-ratio and the radioactive build-up 24 and 48 hours after injection of 131I-HSA was reduced in animals treated with D-pen for 42 days, indicating an impeded transmural transport of tracer which may be caused by a steric exclusion effect of abundant hyaluronate. The endothelial ultrastructure was unaffected by D-pen, and no differences in aortic 131I-HSA radioactivity or aorta/serum-ratio were recorded between experimental and control groups 10 minutes after tracer injection, indicating that the permeability of the endothelial barrier to albumin remained unaffected by D-pen treatment. These observations support the hypothesis that treatment with high doses of D-pen may induce a fibroproliferative response in rat aorta, possibly by an inhibitory effect on the cross-linking of collagen and elastin.",1,0,0,0

"Mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension in the rat. -Tacrolimus (FK 506) is a powerful, widely used immunosuppressant. The clinical utility of FK 506 is complicated by substantial hypertension and nephrotoxicity. To clarify the mechanisms of FK 506-induced hypertension, we studied the chronic effects of FK 506 on the synthesis of endothelin-1 (ET-1), the expression of mRNA of ET-1 and endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity, and the expression of mRNA of eNOS and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in rat blood vessels. In addition, the effect of the specific endothelin type A receptor antagonist FR 139317 on FK 506-induced hypertension in rats was studied. FK 506, 5 mg. kg-1. d-1 given for 4 weeks, elevated blood pressure from 102+/-13 to 152+/-15 mm Hg and increased the synthesis of ET-1 and the levels of ET-1 mRNA in the mesenteric artery (240% and 230%, respectively). Little change was observed in the expression of ECE-1 mRNA and CNP mRNA. FK 506 decreased eNOS activity and the levels of eNOS mRNA in the aorta (48% and 55%, respectively). The administration of FR 139317 (10 mg. kg-1. d-1) prevented FK 506-induced hypertension in rats. These results indicate that FK 506 may increase blood pressure not only by increasing ET-1 production but also by decreasing NO synthesis in the vasculature.",1,1,1,0

"Systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside-induced hypotension in ventilated dogs. The systolic pressure variation (SPV), which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure (SBP) after one positive-pressure breath, was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypotension. Mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm Hg for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage (HEM, n = 7) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside (SNP, n = 7). During HEM-induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the SNP group. The systemic, central venous, pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, and heart rates, were similar in the two groups. Analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two groups. The SPV during hypotension was 15.7 +/- 6.7 mm Hg in the HEM group, compared with 9.1 +/- 2.0 mm Hg in the SNP group (P less than 0.02). The delta down, which is the measure of decrease of SBP after a mechanical breath, was 20.3 +/- 8.4 and 10.1 +/- 3.8 mm Hg in the HEM and SNP groups, respectively, during hypotension (P less than 0.02). It is concluded that increases in the SPV and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in preload. They are thus more important during absolute hypovolemia than during deliberate hypotension.",1,0,0,0
"BRCA1 mutations in a population-based sample of young women with breast cancer. BACKGROUND . Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene are associated with a high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in some families . However , little is known about the contribution of BRCA1 mutations to breast cancer in the general population . We analyzed DNA samples from women enrolled in a population-based study of early-onset breast cancer to assess the spectrum and frequency of germ-line BRCA1 mutations in young women with breast cancer . METHODS . We studied 80 women in whom breast cancer was diagnosed before the age of 35 , and who were not selected on the basis of family history . Genomic DNA was studied for BRCA1 mutations by analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms and with allele-specific assays . Alterations were defined by DNA sequencing . RESULTS . Germ-line BRCA1 mutations were identified in 6 of the 80 women . Four additional rare sequence variants of unknown functional importance were also identified . Two of the mutations and three of the rare sequence variants were found among the 39 women who reported no family history of breast or ovarian cancer . None of the mutations and only one of the rare variants was identified in a reference population of 73 unrelated subjects . CONCLUSIONS . Alterations in BRCA1 were identified in approximately 10 percent of this cohort of young women with breast cancer . The risk of harboring a mutation was not limited to women with family histories of breast or ovarian cancer . These results represent a minimal estimate of the frequency of BRCA1 mutations in this population . Comprehensive methods of identifying BRCA1 mutations and understanding their importance will be needed before testing of women in the general population can be undertaken . .",0,0,1,1
"Studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker, CNSB002, in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the antihyperalgesic effect of CNSB002, a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. DESIGN: Dose response curves for nonsedating doses of morphine and CNSB002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for antihyperalgesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models: carrageenan-induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic neuropathy. RESULTS: The maximum nonsedating doses were: morphine, 3.2 mg/kg; CNSB002 10.0 mg/kg; 5.0 mg/kg CNSB002 with morphine 3.2 mg/kg in combination. The doses calculated to cause 50% reversal of hyperalgesia (ED50) were 7.54 (1.81) and 4.83 (1.54) in the carrageenan model and 44.18 (1.37) and 9.14 (1.24) in the STZ-induced neuropathy model for CNSB002 and morphine, respectively (mg/kg; mean, SEM). These values were greater than the maximum nonsedating doses. The ED50 values for morphine when given in combination with CNSB002 (5 mg/kg) were less than the maximum nonsedating dose: 0.56 (1.55) in the carrageenan model and 1.37 (1.23) in the neuropathy model (mg/kg; mean, SEM). The antinociception after morphine (3.2 mg/kg) was increased by co-administration with CNSB002 from 28.0 and 31.7% to 114.6 and 56.9% reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models, respectively (P < 0.01; one-way analysis of variance-significantly greater than either drug given alone). CONCLUSIONS: The maximum antihyperalgesic effect achievable with nonsedating doses of morphine may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with CNSB002.",0,0,1,0
"Effect of aspirin on N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide-induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and forestomach of the rat. The co-administration of aspirin with N-[4-(5-nitro-2-furyl)-2-thiazolyl]-formamide (FANFT) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of FANFT-induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of forestomach tumors. An autoradiographic study was performed on male F-344 rats fed diet containing FANFT at a level of 0.2% and/or aspirin at a level of 0.5% to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by FANFT in the forestomach and bladder. FANFT-induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co-administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 weeks. In the forestomach, and also in the liver, aspirin did not affect the FANFT-induced increase in labeling index. The present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in FANFT carcinogenesis in the bladder and forestomach, and that aspirin's effect on FANFT in the forestomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell proliferation. Also, there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin.",0,1,1,1

"A high incidence of BRCA1 mutations in 20 breast-ovarian cancer families. We have analyzed 20 breast-ovarian cancer families , the majority of which show positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 gene . BRCA1 mutations cosegregating with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility were identified in 16 families , including 1 family with a case of male breast cancer . Nine of these mutations have not been reported previously . The majority of mutations were found to generate a premature stop codon leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein of 2 % -88 % of the expected normal length . Two mutations altered the RING finger domain . Sequencing of genomic DNA led to the identification of a mutation in the coding region of BRCA1 in 12 families , and cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or missing BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the 8 remaining families . A total of eight mutations were associated with a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript . We were unable to detect BRCA1 mutations in 4 of the 20 families , but only 1 of these was clearly linked to BRCA1 . It is expected that the majority of clear examples of the breast-ovarian syndrome will be associated with germ-line mutations in the coding region of BRCA1 . .",0,0,0,1
"Incidence of solid tumours among pesticide applicators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diazinon in the Agricultural Health Study: an updated analysis. OBJECTIVE: Diazinon, a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties, was previously associated with lung cancer in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, but few other epidemiological studies have examined diazinon-associated cancer risk. We used updated diazinon exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the AHS. METHODS: Male pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina reported lifetime diazinon use at enrolment (1993-1997) and follow-up (1998-2005); cancer incidence was assessed through 2010(North Carolina)/2011(Iowa). Among applicators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure-response patterns, we used Poisson regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios (RRs) and 95% CI for cancer sites with >10 exposed cases for both lifetime (LT) exposure days and intensity-weighted (IW) lifetime exposure days (accounting for factors impacting exposure). RESULTS: We observed elevated lung cancer risks (N=283) among applicators with the greatest number of LT (RR=1.60; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.31; Ptrend=0.02) and IW days of diazinon use (RR=1.41; 95% CI 0.98 to 2.04; Ptrend=0.08). Kidney cancer (N=94) risks were non-significantly elevated (RRLT days=1.77; 95% CI 0.90 to 3.51; Ptrend=0.09; RRIW days 1.37; 95% CI 0.64 to 2.92; Ptrend=0.50), as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer (N=656). CONCLUSIONS: Our updated evaluation of diazinon provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer risk. Newly identified links to kidney cancer and associations with aggressive prostate cancer require further evaluation.",0,1,0,1
"Acute renal failure subsequent to the administration of rifampicin. A follow-up study of cases reported earlier. A clinical presentation is made of a 2-3 year follow-up of six cases of acute renal failure that have been reported earlier. The patients had developed transient renal failure after the intermittent administration of rifampicin. The stage of olig-anuria lasted for 1-3 weeks, and five of the patients were treated by hemodialysis. Two of the patients died due to unrelated causes during the follow-up period. The four patients re-examined were clinically cured. Pathologic findings by light microscopy and immunofluorescence at biopsy were scarce. Nothing abnormal was seen by electron microscopy in two of the cases studied. Renal function was normal. In three cases the excretion at 131I-hippuran renography was slightly slowed. Although in the acute stage the renal lesions histologically appeared toxic, evidence suggestive of an immunological mechanism cannot be excluded.",0,1,0,0
"Type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure: prevention with hepatitis B immune globulin. Final report of the Veterans Administration Cooperative Study. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and immune serum globulin (ISG) were examined in a randomized, double-blind trial to assess their relative efficacies in preventing type B hepatitis after needle-stick exposure to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAG)-positive donors. Clinical hepatitis developed in 1.4% of HBIG and in 5.9% of ISG recipients (P = 0.016), and seroconversion (anti-HBs) occurred in 5.6% and 20.7% of them respectively (P less than 0.001). Mild and transient side-effects were noted in 3.0% of ISG and in 3.2% of HBIG recipients. Available donor sera were examined for DNA polymerase (DNAP) and e antigen and antibody (HBeAg; anti-HBE). Both DNAP and HBeAg showed a highly statistically significant correlation with the infectivity of HBsAg-positive donors. Hepatitis B immune globulin remained significantly superior to ISG in preventing type B hepatitis even when the analysis was confined to these two high-risk subgroups. The efficacy of ISG in preventing type B hepatitis cannot be ascertained because a true placebo group was not included.",0,1,0,0

"Hypercalcemia, arrhythmia, and mood stabilizers. Recent findings in a bipolar patient receiving maintenance lithium therapy who developed hypercalcemia and severe bradyarrhythmia prompted the authors to conduct a retrospective study of bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia. A printout of all cases of hypercalcemia that presented during a 1-year period was generated. After eliminating spurious hypercalcemias or those associated with intravenous fluids, the authors identified 18 non-lithium-treated patients with hypercalcemias related to malignancies and other medical conditions (group A) and 12 patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia (group B). Patients in group B were not comparable to those in group A, as the latter were medically compromised and were receiving multiple pharmacotherapies. Thus, two control groups were generated: group C1, which included age- and sex-comparable lithium-treated bipolar normocalcemic patients, and group C2, which included bipolar normocalcemic patients treated with anticonvulsant mood stabilizers. The electrocardiographic (ECG) findings for patients in group B were compared with those of patients in groups C1 and C2. It was found that these groups did not differ in their overall frequency of ECG abnormalities; however, there were significant differences in the frequency of conduction defects. Patients with hypercalcemia resulting from medical diseases and bipolar patients with lithium-associated hypercalcemia had significantly higher frequencies of conduction defects. Patients in group A had significant mortality at 2-year follow-up (28%), in contrast to zero mortality in the other three groups. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",1,0,0,0

"Functional link between ataxia-telangiectasia and Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products. Ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) and Nijmegen breakage syndrome ( NBS ) are recessive genetic disorders with susceptibility to cancer and similar cellular phenotypes . The protein product of the gene responsible for A-T , designated ATM , is a member of a family of kinases characterized by a carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain . The NBS1 protein is specifically mutated in patients with Nijmegen breakage syndrome and forms a complex with the DNA repair proteins Rad50 and Mrel1 . Here we show that phosphorylation of NBS1 , induced by ionizing radiation , requires catalytically active ATM . Complexes containing ATM and NBS1 exist in vivo in both untreated cells and cells treated with ionizing radiation . We have identified two residues of NBS1 , Ser 278 and Ser 343 that are phosphorylated in vitro by ATM and whose modification in vivo is essential for the cellular response to DNA damage . This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation , formation of the NBS1 / Mrel1 / Rad50 nuclear foci and rescue of hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation . Together , these results demonstrate a biochemical link between cell-cycle checkpoints activated by DNA damage and DNA repair in two genetic diseases with overlapping phenotypes . .",0,0,1,1
"Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring during fluorouracil therapy: a prospective study. Although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy, this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fashion. We prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients were monitored for 23 +/- 4 hours before 5-FU infusion, and 98 +/- 9 hours during 5-FU infusion. Anginal episodes were rare: only one patient had angina (during 5-FU infusion). However, asymptomatic ST changes (greater than or equal to 1 mm ST deviation) were common: six of 25 patients (24%) had ST changes before 5-FU infusion v 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P less than .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 +/- 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion v 0.13 +/- 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P less than .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 +/- 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU v 1.9 +/- 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P less than .01). ECG changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery disease. There were two cases of sudden death, both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that 5-FU infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly among patients with coronary artery disease. The mechanism and clinical significance of these ECG changes remain to be determined.",1,0,0,1
"Paclitaxel 3-hour infusion given alone and combined with carboplatin: preliminary results of dose-escalation trials. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) by 3-hour infusion was combined with carboplatin in a phase I/II study directed to patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Carboplatin was given at a fixed target area under the concentration-time curve of 6.0 by the Calvert formula, whereas paclitaxel was escalated in patient cohorts from 150 mg/m2 (dose level I) to 175, 200, 225, and 250 mg/m2. The 225 mg/m2 level was expanded for the phase II study since the highest level achieved (250 mg/m2) required modification because of nonhematologic toxicities (arthralgia and sensory neuropathy). Therapeutic effects were noted at all dose levels, with objective responses in 17 (two complete and 15 partial regressions) of 41 previously untreated patients. Toxicities were compared with a cohort of patients in a phase I trial of paclitaxel alone at identical dose levels. Carboplatin did not appear to add to the hematologic toxicities observed, and the paclitaxel/carboplatin combination could be dosed every 3 weeks.",0,0,1,1

"Influence of smoking on developing cochlea. Does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns?. OBJECTIVE: Maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal growth. The influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated, although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adults. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) of healthy neonates. METHODS: This study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 newborns. Newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy (n=200 ears) were compared to a control group of newborns (n=200 ears), whose mothers were non-smokers. Exposure to tobacco was characterized as low (<5 cigarettes per day, n=88 ears), moderate (5< or =cigarettes per day<10, n=76) or high (> or =10 cigarettes per day, n=36). RESULTS: In exposed neonates, TEOAEs mean response (across frequency) and mean amplitude at 4000Hz was significantly lower than in non-exposed neonates. Comparisons between exposed newborns' subgroups revealed no significant differences. However, by comparing each subgroup to control group, we found statistically significant decreases of TEOAEs amplitudes at 4000Hz for all three groups. Mean TEOAEs responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control group. CONCLUSION: In utero, exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cells. These effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns, regardless of the degree of exposure. Further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate's hearing acuity.",0,0,1,0

"Prolonged left ventricular dysfunction occurs in patients with coronary artery disease after both dobutamine and exercise induced myocardial ischaemia. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether pharmacological stress leads to prolonged but reversible left ventricular dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease, similar to that seen after exercise. DESIGN: A randomised crossover study of recovery time of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function after exercise and dobutamine induced ischaemia. SUBJECTS: 10 patients with stable angina, angiographically proven coronary artery disease, and normal left ventricular function. INTERVENTIONS: Treadmill exercise and dobutamine stress were performed on different days. Quantitative assessment of systolic and diastolic left ventricular function was performed using transthoracic echocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals after each test. RESULTS: Both forms of stress led to prolonged but reversible systolic and diastolic dysfunction. There was no difference in the maximum double product (p = 0.53) or ST depression (p = 0.63) with either form of stress. After exercise, ejection fraction was reduced at 15 and 30 minutes compared with baseline (mean (SEM), -5.6 (1.5)%, p < 0.05; and -6.1 (2.2)%, p < 0. 01), and at 30 and 45 minutes after dobutamine (-10.8 (1.8)% and -5. 5 (1.8)%, both p < 0.01). Regional analysis showed a reduction in the worst affected segment 15 and 30 minutes after exercise (-27.9 (7.2)% and -28.6 (5.7)%, both p < 0.01), and at 30 minutes after dobutamine (-32 (5.3)%, p < 0.01). The isovolumic relaxation period was prolonged 45 minutes after each form of stress (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with coronary artery disease, dobutamine induced ischaemia results in prolonged reversible left ventricular dysfunction, presumed to be myocardial stunning, similar to that seen after exercise. Dobutamine induced ischaemia could therefore be used to study the pathophysiology of this phenomenon further in patients with coronary artery disease.",1,0,1,0

"Two mouse lines selected for differential sensitivities to beta-carboline-induced seizures are also differentially sensitive to various pharmacological effects of other GABA(A) receptor ligands. Two mouse lines were selectively bred according to their sensitivity (BS line) or resistance (BR line) to seizures induced by a single i.p. injection of methyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCM), an inverse agonist of the GABA(A) receptor benzodiazepine site. Our aim was to characterize both lines' sensitivities to various physiological effects of other ligands of the GABA(A) receptor. We measured diazepam-induced anxiolysis with the elevated plus-maze test, diazepam-induced sedation by recording the vigilance states, and picrotoxin- and pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures after i.p. injections. Results presented here show that the differential sensitivities of BS and BR lines to beta-CCM can be extended to diazepam, picrotoxin, and pentylenetetrazol, suggesting a genetic selection of a general sensitivity and resistance to several ligands of the GABA(A) receptor.",0,0,1,0

The principal biochemical abnormality is the accumulation of saturated very-long-chain fatty acids ( VLCFAs  > C22  0 , mainly C26  0 ) , which is due to impaired capacity for beta-oxidation in peroxisomes . Diagnosis is usually based on the VLCFA levels in plasma or cultured skin fibroblasts in both patients and carriers . In 0 . 1 % of affected males , however , the plasma C26  0 level is borderline normal , and 15 % of obligate female carriers have normal results . Effective mutation detection in these families is therefore fundamental to unambiguously determine the genetic status of each individual at risk . Of particular concern are female members of kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations , because normal VLCFA levels do not guarantee lack of carrier status . We describe a fast method for detection of X-ALD mutations . The method is based on SSCP analysis of nested PCR fragments followed by sequence-determination reactions . Using this methodology we have found X-ALD mutations in 30 kindreds , including 15 not previously reported .",0,1,1,0

"Asterixis induced by carbamazepine therapy. There are very few reports about asterixis as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmacologic agents. In this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs, in whom asterixis was triggered either by adding carbamazepine (CBZ) to a treatment regimen, or by increasing its dosage. Neither dosage nor serum levels of CBZ were in a higher range. We consider asterixis to be an easily overlooked sign of neurotoxicity, which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels, if certain drugs as lithium or clozapine are used in combination with CBZ.",0,0,1,0
"The flavonoid apigenin delays forgetting of passive avoidance conditioning in rats. The present experiments were performed to study the effect of the flavonoid apigenin (20 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.), 1 h before acquisition), on 24 h retention performance and forgetting of a step-through passive avoidance task, in young male Wistar rats. There were no differences between saline- and apigenin-treated groups in the 24 h retention trial. Furthermore, apigenin did not prevent the amnesia induced by scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p., 30 min before the acquisition). The saline- and apigenin-treated rats that did not step through into the dark compartment during the cut-off time (540 s) were retested weekly for up to eight weeks. In the saline treated group, the first significant decline in passive avoidance response was observed at four weeks, and complete memory loss was found five weeks after the acquisition of the passive avoidance task. At the end of the experimental period, 60% of the animals treated with apigenin still did not step through. These data suggest that 1) apigenin delays the long-term forgetting but did not modulate the 24 h retention of fear memory and 2) the obtained beneficial effect of apigenin on the passive avoidance conditioning is mediated by mechanisms that do not implicate its action on the muscarinic cholinergic system.",0,0,1,0
"Adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (Krabbe disease): analysis of galactosylceramidase cDNA from four Japanese patients. We examined galactosylceramidase ( GALC ) cDNA in four Japanese patients with adult onset globoid cell leukodystrophy ( Krabbe disease ; AO-GLD ) by polymerase chain reaction / single-strand conformation polymorphism ( PCR-SSCP ) analysis , subsequent sequence determination , and restriction enzyme digestion of PCR products , initial symptoms were the onset of slowly progressive spastic paraplegia from the middle of the second decade , and all patients had diminished GALC activity in their leukocytes . We identified three missense mutations ( I66M , G270D , L618S ) and one exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) . Two of the patients had only the I66M mutant mRNA , and one only the G27OD mutant mRNA . The fourth patient carried a compound heterozygous mutation of 535-573del and L618S . To determine the enzymatic activities produced by these mutations , we constructed mutated GALC cDNAs and expressed them in COS-1 cells . Three mutations , viz . , G270D , L618S , and exon-6 skipping ( 535-573del ) , produced diminished GALC activity as expected . The I66M mutation in the wild-type GALC cDNA ( I289 ) had normal activity , but when this mutation and the V289 polymorphism were introduced into the same allele , it had decreased activity . Thus , the combination of a unique mutation and polymorphism causes conformational change in the GALC enzyme , resulting in low enzymatic activity . AO-GLD mutations , including those found here , are located in the N-terminus ( I66M , G270D , 535-573del ) or C-terminus ( L618S ) of the GALC enzyme , whereas the reported mutations in the infantile form ( IF-GLD ) are in the central domain .

"Antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of cibenzoline on canine ventricular arrhythmias. Using two-stage coronary ligation-, digitalis-, and adrenaline-induced canine ventricular arrhythmias, antiarrhythmic effects of cibenzoline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determined. Cibenzoline suppressed all the arrhythmias, and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24-h coronary ligation, 48-h coronary ligation, digitalis, and adrenaline were 1.9 +/- 0.9 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 1.6 +/- 0.5 (by 8 mg/kg i.v.), 0.6 +/- 0.2 (by 2 mg/kg i.v.), and 3.5 +/- 1.3 (by 5 mg/kg i.v.) micrograms/ml, respectively (mean +/- SDM, n = 6-7). The concentration for adrenaline-induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhythmias. This pharmacological profile is similar to those of mexiletine and tocainide, and all three drugs have central nervous system (CNS) stimulant action. Because cibenzoline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs, its clinical usefulness is expected.",1,1,1,0
"Cefotetan-induced immune hemolytic anemia. Immune hemolytic anemia due to a drug-adsorption mechanism has been described primarily in patients receiving penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. We describe a patient who developed anemia while receiving intravenous cefotetan. Cefotetan-dependent antibodies were detected in the patient's serum and in an eluate prepared from his red blood cells. The eluate also reacted weakly with red blood cells in the absence of cefotetan, suggesting the concomitant formation of warm-reactive autoantibodies. These observations, in conjunction with clinical and laboratory evidence of extravascular hemolysis, are consistent with drug-induced hemolytic anemia, possibly involving both drug-adsorption and autoantibody formation mechanisms. This case emphasizes the need for increased awareness of hemolytic reactions to all cephalosporins.",0,0,1,0
"Germline mutations of the BRCA1 gene in breast and ovarian cancer families provide evidence for a genotype-phenotype correlation. Mutations in the BRCA1 gene , discovered in 1994 , are associated with an 80-90 % lifetime risk of breast cancer . We have analysed 60 families with a history of breast and / or ovarian cancer for germline mutations in BRCA1 . Twenty-two different mutations were detected in 32 families ( 53 % ) , of which 14 are previously unreported . We observed a significant correlation between the location of the mutation in the gene and the ratio of breast to ovarian cancer incidence within each family . Our data suggest a transition in risk such that mutations in the 3 third of the gene are associated with a lower proportion of ovarian cancer . Haplotype analysis supports previous data which suggest some BRCA1 mutation carriers have common ancestors ; however , we have found at least two examples where recurrent mutations appear to have arisen independently . .",0,0,0,1

"Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna. A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle. Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna. The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna. Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d. Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d. There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria. At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1). The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion. Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial. The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria. The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to  890 per cycle. Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.",0,1,0,0

"High-dose tranexamic Acid is associated with nonischemic clinical seizures in cardiac surgical patients. BACKGROUND: In 2 separate centers, we observed a notable increase in the incidence of postoperative convulsive seizures from 1.3% to 3.8% in patients having undergone major cardiac surgical procedures. These events were temporally coincident with the initial use of high-dose tranexamic acid (TXA) therapy after withdrawal of aprotinin from general clinical usage. The purpose of this review was to perform a retrospective analysis to examine whether there was a relation between TXA usage and seizures after cardiac surgery. METHODS: An in-depth chart review was undertaken in all 24 patients who developed perioperative seizures. Electroencephalographic activity was recorded in 11 of these patients, and all patients had a formal neurological evaluation and brain imaging studies. RESULTS: Twenty-one of the 24 patients did not have evidence of new cerebral ischemic injury, but seizures were likely due to ischemic brain injury in 3 patients. All patients with seizures did not have permanent neurological abnormalities. All 24 patients with seizures received high doses of TXA intraoperatively ranging from 61 to 259 mg/kg, had a mean age of 69.9 years, and 21 of 24 had undergone open chamber rather than coronary bypass procedures. All but one patient were managed using cardiopulmonary bypass. No evidence of brain ischemic, metabolic, or hyperthermia-induced causes for their seizures was apparent. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that use of high-dose TXA in older patients in conjunction with cardiopulmonary bypass and open-chamber cardiac surgery is associated with clinical seizures in susceptible patients.",1,0,1,0
"Cauda equina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5% lignocaine: a review of six cases of cauda equina syndrome reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance 1993-1997. Six cases of cauda equina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the Swedish Pharmaceutical Insurance during the period 1993-1997. All were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. Five cases had single-shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate block. The dose of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 mg. Three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5% lignocaine. In the other 3 cases, direct neurotoxicity was also probable, but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive aetiology. All cases sustained permanent neurological deficits. We recommend that hyperbaric lignocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2% and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg.",0,0,1,0

"Lone atrial fibrillation associated with creatine monohydrate supplementation. Atrial fibrillation in young patients without structural heart disease is rare. Therefore, when the arrhythmia is present in this population, reversible causes must be identified and resolved. Thyroid disorders, illicit drug or stimulant use, and acute alcohol intoxication are among these causes. We report the case of a 30-year-old Caucasian man who came to the emergency department in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. His medical history was unremarkable, except for minor fractures of the fingers and foot. Thyroid-stimulating hormone, magnesium, and potassium levels were within normal limits, urine drug screen was negative, and alcohol use was denied. However, when the patient was questioned about use of herbal products and supplements, the use of creatine monohydrate was revealed. The patient was admitted to the hospital, anticoagulated with unfractionated heparin, and given intravenous diltiazem for rate control and intravenous amiodarone for rate and rhythm control. When discharged less than 24 hours later, he was receiving metoprolol and aspirin, with follow-up plans for echocardiography and nuclear imaging to assess perfusion. Exogenous creatine is used by athletes to theoretically improve exercise performance. Vegetarians may also take creatine to replace what they are not consuming from meat, fish, and other animal products. Previous anecdotal reports have linked creatine to the development of arrhythmia. Clinicians must be diligent when interviewing patients about their drug therapy histories and include questions about their use of herbal products and dietary supplements. In addition, it is important to report adverse effects associated with frequently consumed supplements and herbal products to the Food and Drug Administration and in the literature.",1,0,0,0

"Incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy in hospitalised patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of and possible factors related to contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in hospitalised patients with cancer. METHODS: Ninety adult patients were enrolled. Patients with risk factors for acute renal failure were excluded. Blood samples were examined the day before contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and serially for 3 days thereafter. CIN was defined as an increase in serum creatinine (Cr) of 0.5 mg/dl or more, or elevation of Cr to 25 % over baseline. Relationships between CIN and possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: CIN was detected in 18/90 (20 %) patients. CIN developed in 25.5 % patients who underwent chemotherapy and in 11 % patients who did not (P = 0.1). CIN more frequently developed in patients who had undergone CT within 45 days after the last chemotherapy (P = 0.005); it was also an independent risk factor (P = 0.017). CIN was significantly more after treatment with bevacizumab/irinotecan (P = 0.021) and in patients with hypertension (P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CIN after CT in hospitalised oncological patients was 20 %. CIN developed 4.5-times more frequently in patients with cancer who had undergone recent chemotherapy. Hypertension and the combination of bevacizumab/irinotecan may be additional risk factors for CIN development. KEY POINTS: . Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a concern for oncological patients undergoing CT. . CIN occurs more often when CT is performed <45 days after chemotherapy. .

"A point mutation Thr(799)Met on the alpha(2) integrin leads to the formation of new human platelet alloantigen Sit(a) and affects collagen-induced aggregation. A new platelet-specific alloantigen , termed Sit ( a ) , was identified in a severe case of neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia . The Sit ( a ) alloantigen is of low frequency ( 1 / 400 ) in the German population . Immunochemical studies demonstrated that the Sit ( a ) epitopes reside on platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ia . Nucleotide sequence analysis of GPIa cDNA derived from Sit ( a ) -positive platelets showed C ( 2531 ) -- > T ( 2531 ) point mutation , resulting in Thr ( 799 ) Met dimorphism . Analysis of genomic DNA from 22 Sit ( a ) -negative normal individuals showed that the Thr ( 799 ) is encoded by ACG ( 2532 ) ( 90 . 9 % ) or ACA ( 2532 ) ( 9 . 1 % ) . To establish a DNA typing technique , we elucidated the organization of the GPIa gene adjacent to the polymorphic bases . The introns ( 421 bp and 1 . 2 kb ) encompass a 142-bp exon with the 2 polymorphic bases 2531 and 2532 . Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis on DNA derived from 100 donors using the restriction enzyme Mae III showed that the Met ( 799 ) form of GPIa is restricted to Sit ( a ) ( + ) phenotype . Analysis of stable Chinese hamster ovary transfectants expressing allele-specific recombinant forms of GPIa showed that anti-Sit ( a ) exclusively reacted with the Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) , but not with the Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) isoforms . In contrast , anti-Br ( a ) ( HPA-5b ) only recognized the Lys ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) form , whereas anti-Br ( b ) ( HPA-5a ) reacted with both Glu ( 505 ) Thr ( 799 ) and Glu ( 505 ) Met ( 799 ) isoforms . These results demonstrated that the Met ( 799 ) is responsible for formation of the Sit ( a ) alloantigenic determinants , whereas amino acid 505 ( Lys or Glu ) specifically controls the expression of Br ( a ) and Br ( b ) epitopes , respectively . Platelet aggregation responses of Sit ( a ) ( + ) individuals were diminished in response to collagen , indicating that the Thr ( 799 ) Met mutation affects the function of the GPIa / IIa complex",0,0,1,0

"Immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in arteritis induced in rats by fenoldopam and theophylline, vasodilators. Arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators, fenoldopam and theophylline, was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1). Rats were administered fenoldopam for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline. Irrespective of theophylline administration, iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on day 5 and 8 post-fenoldopam-infusion (DPI); bFGF antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on 1 and 3 DPI; TGF-beta1 antigens were observed in ED-1-positive cells on and after 5 DPI. These results suggest that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was followed by that of bFGF antigen, and bFGF may have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these rat arteritis models. On the other hand, TGF-beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.",0,0,0,1

"Nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation. To quantify the effects of gentamicin, kanamycin and netilmicin on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation, these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally (30 mg/kg/day) for 7, 14 or 21 days. Scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endothelia, urinary measurements of sodium, potassium, endogenous lysozyme, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance (GFR) were done in each treatment group. Gentamicin administration decreased diameter, density and shape of endothelial fenestrae. Kanamycin and netilmicin appeared to have no effect at the dose used. All three aminoglycosides decreased GFR and increased urinary excretion of sodium and potassium. While gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg-white lysozyme netilmicin had no effect. Daily excretion of total protein, endogenous lysozyme and NAG increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentamicin. Thus, aminoglycosides may act as nephrotoxicants at glomerular and/or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins.",0,1,0,0
"Consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune diseases. Worldwide, over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase I and II clinical trials. The results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase III trials. However, as predicted, significant transplant-related morbidity and mortality have been observed. This is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infections. The number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low. However, caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage, for example, systemic sclerosis patients. In November 2002, a meeting was held in Florence, bringing together a number of experts in various fields, including rheumatology, cardiology, neurology, pharmacology and transplantation medicine. The object of the meeting was to analyse existing data, both published or available, in the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation autoimmune disease database, and to propose a safe approach to such patients.

PATIENTS: Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. INTERVENTION: Each patient received either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by 1 week off, or the combination of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening plus the same docetaxel regimen. This 4-week cycle was repeated until there was evidence of excessive toxicity or disease progression. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: None of 23 patients who received docetaxel alone developed VTE, whereas 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE (p=0.025). CONCLUSION: The addition of thalidomide to docetaxel in the treatment of prostate cancer significantly increases the frequency of VTE. Clinicians should be aware of this potential complication when adding thalidomide to chemotherapeutic regimens.",0,0,0,1

"Cardiac arrest in a child with cerebral palsy undergoing sevoflurane induction of anesthesia after preoperative clonidine. Clonidine is a frequently administered alpha2-adrenergic agonist which can decrease heart rate and blood pressure. We present a case of a 5-year-old child with cerebral palsy and seizure disorder, receiving clonidine for restlessness, who presented for placement of a baclofen pump. Without the knowledge of the medical personnel, the patient's mother administered three doses of clonidine during the evening before and morning of surgery to reduce anxiety. During induction of anesthesia, the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring cardiac resuscitation. There are no previous reports of clonidine-associated cardiac arrest in a child undergoing induction of anesthesia.",1,0,1,0
"Metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardiotoxicity. The cardiotoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system. Adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in culture. A possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously, and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphorylcreatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin-treated cells. The adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased, while the phophorylcreatine mole fraction was unchanged. Such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phosphokinase. The addition of 1 mM adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the ATP concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartmentalized ATP pool. In the adriamycin-treated cells, the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and, concomitant with this inrcease, the cells' functional integrity, in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions, was maintained.",1,0,1,0

"Amino-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin show selective accumulation in striatal neurons and synaptic toxicity. Huntington disease ( HD ) is caused by expansion of a glutamine repeat in the amino-terminal region of huntingtin . Despite its widespread expression , mutant huntingtin induces selective neuronal loss in striatal neurons . Here we report that , in mutant mice expressing HD repeats , the production and aggregation of N-terminal huntingtin fragments preferentially occur in HD-affected neurons and their processes and axonal terminals . N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin form aggregates and induce neuritic degeneration in cultured striatal neurons . N-terminal mutant huntingtin also binds to synaptic vesicles and inhibits their glutamate uptake in vitro . The specific processing and accumulation of toxic fragments of N-terminal huntingtin in HD-affected striatal neurons , especially in their neuronal processes and axonal terminals , may contribute to the selective neuropathology of HD . .",0,0,1,0
"The hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neuraxial anesthesia for cesarean delivery: findings in six cases. Oxytocin is a commonly used uterotonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension, particularly when given as a bolus. The resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous return. Parturients with normal volume status, heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volume. Oxytocin-induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood loss. Pulse power analysis (also called ""pulse contour analysis"") of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time, thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pressure. Pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume, heart rate and cardiac output. Pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neuraxial anesthesia.",1,1,0,0
"Open-label assessment of levofloxacin for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis in adults. PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of levofloxacin (500 mg orally once daily for 10 to 14 days) in treating adult outpatients with acute bacterial sinusitis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 329 patients enrolled in the study at 24 centers. All patients had a pre-therapy Gram's stain and culture of sinus exudate obtained by antral puncture or nasal endoscopy. Clinical response was assessed on the basis of signs and symptoms and sinus radiograph or computed tomography results. Microbiologic cure rates were determined on the basis of presumed plus documented eradication of the pre-therapy pathogen(s). RESULTS: The most common pathogens were Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of 300 clinically evaluable patients, 175 (58%) were cured and 90 (30%) were improved at the post-therapy evaluation, resulting in a clinical success rate of 88%. Thirty-five patients (12%) clinically failed treatment. The microbiologic eradication rate (presumed plus documented) among 138 microbiologically evaluable patients was 92%. Microbiologic eradication rates (presumed plus documented) of the most common pathogens ranged from 93% (M. catarrhalis) to 100% (S. pneumoniae) at the post-therapy visit. All but one of the 265 patients who were cured or improved at post-therapy returned for a long-term follow-up visit; 243 (92%) remained well 4 to 6 weeks after therapy; and 21 (8%) had a relapse of symptoms. Adverse events considered to be related to levofloxacin administration were reported by 29 patients (9%). The most common drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, flatulence, and nausea; most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity. CONCLUSION: The results of this study indicate that levofloxacin 500 mg once daily is an effective and safe treatment for acute bacterial sinusitis.",0,0,1,0

"The 3-week sulphasalazine syndrome strikes again. A 34-year-old lady developed a constellation of dermatitis, fever, lymphadenopathy and hepatitis, beginning on the 17th day of a course of oral sulphasalazine for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. Cervical and inguinal lymph node biopsies showed the features of severe necrotising lymphadenitis, associated with erythrophagocytosis and prominent eosinophilic infiltrates, without viral inclusion bodies, suggestive of an adverse drug reaction.A week later, fulminant drug-induced hepatitis, associated with the presence of anti-nuclear autoantibodies (but not with other markers of autoimmunity), and accompanied by multi-organ failure and sepsis, supervened. She subsequently died some 5 weeks after the commencement of her drug therapy.Post-mortem examination showed evidence of massive hepatocellular necrosis, acute hypersensitivity myocarditis, focal acute tubulo-interstitial nephritis and extensive bone marrow necrosis, with no evidence of malignancy. It is thought that the clinico-pathological features and chronology of this case bore the hallmarks of the so-called ""3-week sulphasalazine syndrome"", a rare, but often fatal, immunoallergic reaction to sulphasalazine.",0,1,0,0
"5 flourouracil-induced apical ballooning syndrome: a case report. The apical ballooning syndrome (ABS) is a recently described stress-mediated acute cardiac syndrome characterized by transient wall-motion abnormalities involving the apex and midventricle with hyperkinesis of the basal left ventricular (LV) segments without obstructive epicardial coronary disease. Cardiotoxicity is not an uncommon adverse effect of chemotherapeutic agents. However, there are no reports of ABS secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. We describe the case of a woman who developed the syndrome after chemotherapy for metastatic cancer. A 79-year-old woman presented with typical ischemic chest pain, elevated cardiac enzymes with significant ST-segment abnormalities on her electrocardiogram. She underwent recent chemotherapy with fluorouracil for metastatic colorectal cancer. Echocardiography revealed a wall-motion abnormality involving the apical and periapical segments which appeared akinetic. Coronary angiography revealed no obstructive coronary lesions. The patient was stabilized with medical therapy. Four weeks later she remained completely asymptomatic. Echocardiogram revealed a normal ejection fraction and a resolution of the apical akinesis. Pathogenetic mechanisms of cardiac complications in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy include coronary vasospasm, endothelial damage and consequent thrombus formation. In our patient, both supraphysiologic levels of plasma catecholamines and stress related neuropeptides caused by cancer diagnosis as well as chemotherapy may have contributed the development of ABS.",1,0,1,1

"Involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl-induced muscular rigidity in the rat. Whereas muscular rigidity is a well-known side effect that is associated with high-dose fentanyl anesthesia, a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism(s). We investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon, using male Sprague-Dawley rats anesthetized with ketamine. Under proper control of respiration, body temperature and end-tidal CO2, intravenous administration of fentanyl (50 or 100 micrograms/kg) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus muscles. Such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electrolytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha-adrenoceptor blocker, prazosin. Microinjection of fentanyl (2.5 micrograms/50 nl) directly into this pontine nucleus, on the other hand, elicited discernible electromyographic excitation. It is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerulospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons.",0,0,1,0

"Beta-catenin accumulation and mutation of the CTNNB1 gene in hepatoblastoma. Hepatoblastoma is a rare malignant tumor of the liver that occurs in children at an average age of 2 to 3 years . Epidemiologic studies have shown an increased frequency of this tumor type in families affected by adenomatous polyposis coli . In addition to the epidemiologic data , molecular genetic studies suggest that inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor may be involved in hepatoblastoma tumorigenesis . A major function of APC is the downregulation of beta-catenin , a transcription-activating protein with oncogenic potential .

"Mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine: comparison with exercise-induced ischemia. The role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery disease. Objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exercise. Both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by ST segment depression and angina. However, the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exercise. Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate-pressure product with a minor contribution of end-diastolic volume, while epinephrine-induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate-pressure product. These findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine, as may occur during states of emotional distress, has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion.",1,0,1,0

"Paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate: report of a case and review of the literature. A patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is discribed. The ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are reviewed. The following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication: abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia, and epidural cerebrospinal leakage; elevated cerebrospinal fluid methothexate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults; the presence of neurotoxic preservatives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and diluents; and the use of methotrexate diluents of unphysiologic pH, ionic content and osmolarity. The role of methotrexate contaminants, local folate deficiency, and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is unclear. The incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia, in older children and adults, and in the presence of epidural leakage. Only preservative-free methotrexate in Elliott's B Solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg/ml should be used for intrathecal administration.

"Effect of methoxamine on maximum urethral pressure in women with genuine stress incontinence: a placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study. The aim of the study was to evaluate the potential role for a selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist in the treatment of urinary stress incontinence.

Half log incremental doses of intravenous methoxamine or placebo (saline) were administered to a group of women with genuine stress incontinence while measuring maximum urethral pressure (MUP), blood pressure, heart rate, and symptomatic side effects. Methoxamine evoked non-significant increases in MUP and diastolic blood pressure but caused a significant rise in systolic blood pressure and significant fall in heart rate at maximum dosage. Systemic side effects including piloerection, headache, and cold extremities were experienced in all subjects. The results indicate that the clinical usefulness of direct, peripherally acting sub-type-selective alpha1-adrenoceptor agonists in the medical treatment of stress incontinence may be limited by associated piloerection and cardiovascular side effects.",1,0,0,0

Patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups: lateral and conventional spinal anaesthesia groups. In the lateral position with operative side down, patients recived 10 mg (2mls) of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine through a 25-gauge spinal needle. Patients in the unilateral group were maintained in the lateral position for 15 minutes following spinal injection while those in the conventional group were turned supine immediately after injection. Blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation were monitored over 1 hour. RESULTS: Three patients (8.1%) in the unilateral group and 5 (13.5%) in the conventional group developed hypotension, P= 0.71. Four (10.8%) patients in the conventional group and 1 (2.7%) in the unilateral group, P= 0.17 required epinephrine infusion to treat hypotension. Patients in the conventional group had statistically significant greater fall in the systolic blood pressures at 15, 30 and 45 minutes when compared to the baseline (P= 0.003, 0.001 and 0.004). The mean respiratory rate and oxygen saturations in the two groups were similar. CONCLUSION: Compared to conventional spinal anaesthesia, unilateral spinal anaesthesia was associated with fewer cardiovascular perturbations. Also, the type of spinal block instituted affected neither the respiratory rate nor the arterial oxygen saturation.",1,0,0,0

"Source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine: an identical site?. Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin (10 patients) or placebo ointment (10 patients) in a double blind study. Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group. Subsequently 20 migraine patients, who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin, received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas. No early onset migraine was observed. Thus the migraine-inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain, suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis. This is not consistent with a CNS origin of migraine attack.",0,0,1,0
"Hyperkalemia induced by indomethacin and naproxen and reversed by fludrocortisone. We have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of mefenamic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypoaldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen, without major decline in renal function. It is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type IV renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors. Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, fludrocortisone was added, correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely.",0,1,0,0
"Dominant negative effect of the APC1309 mutation: a possible explanation for genotype-phenotype correlations in familial adenomatous polyposis. Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis . Patients with familial APC ( FAP ) carry germ-line mutations in the APC gene and develop multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life . The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation ( genotype-phenotype correlation ) . Together with the fact that both germ-line and sporadic APC mutations cluster in the central region of the APC gene , this points to a dominant negative effect of certain APC mutants . Loss of APC function was recently shown to result in enhanced beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells . Here , we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products associated with severe polyposis . Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin- / Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309 . In contrast , mutant APC gene products that are associated with attenuated polyposis ( codon 386 or 1465 ) interfered only weakly with wild-type APC activity . These results suggest a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the idea that colorectal tumor growth might be , in part , driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region . .",0,0,0,1

"Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels, prolactin signaling, and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol. Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido. Although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this, the mechanisms are poorly understood. We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility: pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen-induced LH surge. Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats, but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol. Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid-induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge. Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors (PRL-R) and components of prolactin's signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL-R expression and sensitivity to prolactin, we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin-induced STAT5 activation. Lastly, we measured PRL-R and suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS, which reflect the level of prolactin signaling) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol. Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area, where GnRH neurons are regulated, but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus, PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels were also induced. Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS. Interestingly, estradiol also induced PRL-R, SOCS-3, and CIS mRNA levels independently. These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid-dependent manner. They also provide evidence for estradiol-dependent and brain region-specific regulation of PRL-R expression and signaling responses by prolactin.",0,0,1,0

"Comparison of the effect of oxitropium bromide and of slow-release theophylline on nocturnal asthma. The effects of a new inhaled antimuscarinic drug, oxitropium bromide, and of a slow-release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo-controlled double-blind study. Two samples were studied: 12 patients received oxitropium at 600 micrograms (6 subjects) or at 400 micrograms t.i.d. (6 subjects) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. Morning dipping, assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight, was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken, whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administration. No significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug, as well as with either dosage of oxitropium. No subject reported side effects of oxitropium, as compared to three subjects reporting nausea, vomiting and tremors after theophylline. Oxitropium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma, since it is equally potent, safer and does not require the titration of dosage.",0,0,1,0

"Animal model of mania induced by ouabain: Evidence of oxidative stress in submitochondrial particles of the rat brain. The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of ouabain (a Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar mania. Clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Herein, we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ICV administration of ouabain in rats. To achieve this aim, the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ICV administration (at concentrations of 10(-2) and 10(-3)M) on locomotion was measured using the open-field test. Additionally, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) and superoxide production were measured in submitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and amygdala. Our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10(-2) and 10(-3)M induced hyperlocomotion in rats, and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ICV injection. In addition, we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased TBARS levels and superoxide generation in submitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex, striatum and amygdala. In conclusion, ouabain-induced mania-like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder.",0,0,1,0

"Gastrointestinal tolerability of etoricoxib in rheumatoid arthritis patients: results of the etoricoxib vs diclofenac sodium gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness trial (EDGE-II). OBJECTIVE: A randomised, double-blind study to compare the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability, safety and efficacy of etoricoxib and diclofenac in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 4086 patients (mean age 60.8 years) diagnosed with RA were enrolled and received etoricoxib 90 mg daily (n = 2032) or diclofenac 75 mg twice daily (n = 2054). Use of gastroprotective agents and low-dose aspirin was allowed. The prespecified primary end point consisted of the cumulative rate of patient discontinuations due to clinical and laboratory GI adverse experiences (AEs). General safety was also assessed, including adjudicated thrombotic cardiovascular event data. Efficacy was evaluated using the Patient Global Assessment of Disease Status (PGADS; 0-4 point scale). RESULTS: Mean (SD; maximum) duration of treatment was 19.3 (10.3; 32.9) and 19.1 (10.4; 33.1) months in the etoricoxib and diclofenac groups, respectively. The cumulative discontinuation rate due to GI AEs was significantly lower with etoricoxib than diclofenac (5.2 vs 8.5 events per 100 patient-years, respectively; hazard ratio 0.62 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.81; p<or=0.001)). The incidence of discontinuations for hypertension-related and oedema-related AEs were significantly higher with etoricoxib (2.5% and 1.1% respectively) compared with diclofenac (1.5% and 0.4% respectively; p<0.001 for hypertension and p<0.01 for oedema). Etoricoxib and diclofenac treatment resulted in similar efficacy (PGADS mean changes from baseline -0.62 vs -0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Etoricoxib 90 mg demonstrated a significantly lower risk for discontinuing treatment due to GI AEs compared with diclofenac 150 mg. Discontinuations from renovascular AEs, although less common than discontinuations from GI AEs, were significantly higher with etoricoxib.",1,0,0,0

"Clinical evaluation of adverse effects during bepridil administration for atrial fibrillation and flutter. BACKGROUND: Bepridil hydrochloride (Bpd) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter (AFL). However, serious adverse effects, including torsade de pointes (Tdp), have been reported. METHODS AND RESULTS: Adverse effects of Bpd requiring discontinuation of treatment were evaluated. Bpd was administered to 459 patients (361 males, 63+/-12 years old) comprising 378 AF and 81 AFL cases. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension (LAD) were 66+/-11% and 40+/-6 mm, respectively. Adverse effects were observed in 19 patients (4%) during an average follow-up of 20 months. There was marked QT prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients, bradycardia less than 40 beats/min in 6 patients, dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient each. In 4 of 13 patients with QT prolongation, Tdp occurred. The major triggering factors of Tdp were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rate. There were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without Tdp other than LAD and age, which were larger and older in the patients with Tdp. CONCLUSION: Careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ECG should always be done during Bpd administration, particularly in elderly patients.",1,0,0,0
"Pallidotomy with the gamma knife: a positive experience. 51 patients with medically refractory Parkinson's disease underwent stereotactic posteromedial pallidotomy between August 1993 and February 1997 for treatment of bradykinesia, rigidity, and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. In 29 patients, the pallidotomies were performed with the Leksell Gamma Knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency (RF) method. Clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were carried out pre- and postoperatively. Mean follow-up time is 20.6 months (range 6-48) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year. 85 percent of patients with dyskinesias were relieved of symptoms, regardless of whether the pallidotomies were performed with the Gamma Knife or radiofrequency methods. About 2/3 of the patients in both Gamma Knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in bradykinesia and rigidity, although when considered as a group neither the Gamma Knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in UPDRS scores. One patient in the Gamma Knife group (3.4%) developed a homonymous hemianopsia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients (27.7%) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused postoperatively. No other complications were seen. Gamma Knife pallidotomy is as effective as radiofrequency pallidotomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. It may be the only practical technique available in certain patients, such as those who take anticoagulants, have bleeding diatheses or serious systemic medical illnesses.

"Epileptogenic activity of folic acid after drug induces SLE (folic acid and epilepsy). OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of folic acid-containing multivitamin supplementation in epileptic women before and during pregnancy in order to determine the rate of structural birth defects and epilepsy-related side effects. STUDY DESIGN: First a randomised trial, later periconception care including in total 12225 females. RESULTS: Of 60 epileptic women with periconceptional folic acid (0.8 mg)-containing multivitamin supplementation, no one developed epilepsy-related side effects during the periconception period. One epileptic woman delivered a newborn with cleft lip and palate. Another patient exhibited with a cluster of seizures after the periconception period using another multivitamin. This 22-year-old epileptic woman was treated continuously by carbamazepine and a folic acid (1 mg)-containing multivitamin from the 20th week of gestation. She developed status epilepticus and later symptoms of systemic lupus erythematodes. Her pregnancy ended with stillbirth. CONCLUSIONS: The epileptic pregnant patient's autoimmune disease (probably drug-induced lupus) could damage the blood-brain barrier, therefore the therapeutic dose (> or =1 mg) of folic acid triggered a cluster of seizures. Physiological dose (<1 mg) of folic acid both in healthy and 60 epileptic women, all without any autoimmune disease, did not increase the risk for epileptic seizures.",0,1,1,0

"Prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus: which is superior: Fentanyl, midazolam, or a combination? A Retrospective comparative study. BACKGROUND: In this retrospective comparative study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of fentanyl, midazolam, and a combination of fentanyl and midazolam to prevent etomidate-induced myoclonus. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This study was performed based on anesthesia records. Depending on the drugs that would be given before the induction of anesthesia with etomidate, the patients were separated into 4 groups: no pretreatment (Group NP), fentanyl 1 ug.kg-1 (Group F), midazolam 0.03 mg.kg-1 (Group M), and midazolam 0.015 mg.kg-1 + fentanyl 0.5 ug.kg-1 (Group FM). Patients who received the same anesthetic procedure were selected: 2 minutes after intravenous injections of the pretreatment drugs, anesthesia is induced with 0.3 mg.kg-1 etomidate injected intravenously over a period of 20-30 seconds. Myoclonic movements are evaluated, which were observed and graded according to clinical severity during the 2 minutes after etomidate injection. The severity of pain due to etomidate injection, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and adverse effects were also evaluated. RESULTS: Study results showed that myoclonus incidence was 85%, 40%, 70%, and 25% in Group NP, Group F, Group M, and Group FM, respectively, and were significantly lower in Group F and Group FM. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that pretreatment with fentanyl or combination of fentanyl and midazolam was effective in preventing etomidate-induced myoclonus.",1,0,0,0

"Myotonic dystrophy: evidence for a possible dominant-negative RNA mutation. The trinucleotide expansion mutation causing myotonic dystrophy is in the 3 untranslated region of a protein kinase gene . The molecular mechanisms by which the expanded repeat causes the clinically variable and multisystemic disease , myotonic dystrophy , are not understood . It has been particularly difficult to rationalize the dominant inheritance with the fact that the expansion mutation lies outside of the protein-encoding gene elements , and should not be translated into protein . Here we use muscle biopsies from classical adult-onset myotonic dystrophy patients to study the accumulation of transcripts from both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes in patient muscle , and compare the results to normal and myopathic controls . We found relatively small decreases of DM kinase RNA in the total RNA pool from muscle ; however , these reductions were not disease specific . Analysis of poly ( A ) + RNA showed dramatic decreases of both the mutant and normal DM kinase RNAs , and these changes were disease-specific . Our findings are consistent with a novel molecular pathogenetic mechanism for myotonic dystrophy  both the normal and expanded DM kinase genes are transcribed in patient muscle , but the abnormal expansion-containing RNA has a dominant effect on RNA metabolism by preventing the accumulation of poly ( A ) + RNA . The ability of the expansion mutation to alter accumulation of poly ( A ) + RNA in trans suggests that myotonic dystrophy may be the first example of a dominant-negative mutation manifested at the RNA level . .",0,0,1,0
"Pseudo-allergic reactions to corticosteroids: diagnosis and alternatives. Two patients treated with parenteral paramethasone (Triniol) and dexamethasone (Sedionbel) are described. A few minutes after administration of the drugs, they presented urticaria (patients 1 and 2) and conjunctivitis (patient 1). The purpose of our study was to determine the cause of the patients' reactions, the immunological mechanisms involved and whether these patients would be able to tolerate any kind of corticoid. Clinical examinations and skin, oral and parenteral challenges with different corticosteroids and ELISA tests were performed. In the two patients, skin and ELISA tests with paramethasone were negative, as was the prick test with each of its excipients. A single-blind parenteral challenge with Triniol was positive in both patients after the administration of 1 ml of the drug, and negative with its excipients. We also carried out oral and parenteral challenges with other corticosteroids and found intolerance to some of them. These results suggest that paramethasone caused pseudoallergic reactions in our patients. Corticosteroids different from paramethasone also produced hypersensitivity reactions in these patients; however, a few of them were tolerated. The basic mechanisms of those reactions are not yet fully understood. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a pseudo-allergy caused by paramethasone.",0,0,1,0
"Tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects. Endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning. Administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients. Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission, the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved. We here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative learning. Forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete nouns over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine-receptor agonist pergolide (0.1 mg) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day. The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo. This learning decrement persisted up to the last follow-up 4 weeks post-training. Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group. The extent of 'flattened' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition. These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals. Thus, phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients.",0,0,1,0

"Additional copies of the proteolipid protein gene causing Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease arise by separate integration into the X chromosome. The proteolipid protein gene ( PLP ) is normally present at chromosome Xq22 . Mutations and duplications of this gene are associated with Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease ( PMD ) . Here we describe two new families in which males affected with PMD were found to have a copy of PLP on the short arm of the X chromosome , in addition to a normal copy on Xq22 . In the first family , the extra copy was first detected by the presence of heterozygosity of the AhaII dimorphism within the PLP gene . The results of FISH analysis showed an additional copy of PLP in Xp22 . 1 , although no chromosomal rearrangements could be detected by standard karyotype analysis . Another three affected males from the family had similar findings . In a second unrelated family with signs of PMD , cytogenetic analysis showed a pericentric inversion of the X chromosome . In the inv ( X ) carried by several affected family members , FISH showed PLP signals at Xp11 . 4 and Xq22 . A third family has previously been reported , in which affected members had an extra copy of the PLP gene detected at Xq26 in a chromosome with an otherwise normal banding pattern .

"L-arginine transport in humans with cortisol-induced hypertension. A deficient L-arginine-nitric oxide system is implicated in cortisol-induced hypertension. We investigate whether abnormalities in L-arginine uptake contribute to this deficiency. Eight healthy men were recruited. Hydrocortisone acetate (50 mg) was given orally every 6 hours for 24 hours after a 5-day fixed-salt diet (150 mmol/d). Crossover studies were performed 2 weeks apart. Thirty milliliters of blood was obtained for isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells after each treatment period. L-arginine uptake was assessed in mononuclear cells incubated with L-arginine (1 to 300 micromol/L), incorporating 100 nmol/L [3H]-l-arginine for a period of 5 minutes at 37 degrees C. Forearm [3H]-L-arginine extraction was calculated after infusion of [3H]-L-arginine into the brachial artery at a rate of 100 nCi/min for 80 minutes. Deep forearm venous samples were collected for determination of L-arginine extraction. Plasma cortisol concentrations were significantly raised during the active phase (323+/-43 to 1082+/-245 mmol/L, P<0.05). Systolic blood pressure was elevated by an average of 7 mm Hg. Neither L-arginine transport into mononuclear cells (placebo vs active, 26.3+/-3.6 vs 29.0+/-2.1 pmol/10 000 cells per 5 minutes, respectively, at an l-arginine concentration of 300 micromol/L) nor L-arginine extraction in the forearm (at 80 minutes, placebo vs active, 1 868 904+/-434 962 vs 2 013 910+/-770 619 disintegrations per minute) was affected by cortisol treatment; ie, that L-arginine uptake is not affected by short-term cortisol treatment.

"Posteroventral medial pallidotomy in advanced Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND: Posteroventral medial pallidotomy sometimes produces striking improvement in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, but the studies to date have involved small numbers of patients and short-term follow-up. METHODS: Forty patients with Parkinson's disease underwent serial, detailed assessments both after drug withdrawal (""off"" period) and while taking their optimal medical regimens (""on"" period). All patients were examined preoperatively and 39 were examined at six months; 27 of the patients were also examined at one year, and 11 at two years. RESULTS: The percent improvements at six months were as follows: off-period score for overall motor function, 28 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 38 percent), with most of the improvement in the contralateral limbs; off-period score for activities of daily living, 29 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 19 to 39 percent); on-period score for contralateral dyskinesias, 82 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 72 to 91 percent); and on-period score for ipsilateral dyskinesias, 44 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 29 to 59 percent). The improvements in dyskinesias and the total scores for off-period parkinsonism, contralateral bradykinesia, and rigidity were sustained in the 11 patients examined at two years. The improvement in ipsilateral dyskinesias was lost after one year, and the improvements in postural stability and gait lasted only three to six months. Approximately half the patients who had been dependent on assistance in activities of daily living in the off period before surgery became independent after surgery. The complications of surgery were generally well tolerated, and there were no significant changes in the use of medication. CONCLUSIONS: In late-stage Parkinson's disease, pallidotomy significantly reduces levodopa-induced dyskinesias and off-period disability. Much of the benefit is sustained at two years, although some improvements, such as those on the ipsilateral side and in axial symptoms, wane within the first year. The on-period symptoms that are resistant to dopaminergic therapy do not respond to pallidotomy.",0,0,1,0

"Interactive effects of variations in [Na]o and [Ca]o on rat atrial spontaneous frequency. The effects of varying the extracellular concentrations of Na and Ca ([Na]o and [Ca]o) on both, the spontaneous beating and the negative chronotropic action of verapamil, were studied in the isolated rat atria. Basal frequency (BF) evaluated by surface electrogram was 223 +/- 4 beats/min. in control Krebs-Ringer containing 137 mM Na and 1.35 mM Ca (N). It decreased by 16 +/- 3% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM (LNa), 23 +/- 2% by lowering simultaneously [Na]o to 78 mM and [Ca]o to 0.675 mM (LNa+LCa) and 31 +/- 5% by lowering [Na]o to 78 mM plus increasing [Ca]o to 3.6 mM (LNa+HCa). At normal [Na]o, decrease (0.675 mM) or increase (3.6 mM) of [Ca]o did not modify BF; a reduction of ten times (0.135 mM of normal [Ca]o was effective to reduce BF by 40 +/- 13%. All negative chronotropic effects were BF-dependent. Dose-dependent bradycardia induced by verapamil was potentiated by LNa, LCa, and HCa. Independent but not additive effects of Na and Ca are shown by decreases in the values of [verapamil]o needed to reduce BF by 30% (IC30) with the following order of inhibitory potency: LNa > LCa > HCa > N, resulting LNa+HCa similar to LNa. The [verapamil]o that arrested atrial beating (AC) was also potentiated with the order LNa = LNa+LCa = LNa+HCa = LCa > HCa = N. The results indicate that rat atrial spontaneous beating is more dependent on [Na]o than on [Ca]o in a range of +/- 50% of their normal concentration. Also the enhancement of verapamil effects on atrial beating was more pronounced at LNa than at LCa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,0,0,0

"Increased expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in bladder afferent pathways following chronic bladder irritation. Immunocytochemical techniques were used to examine alterations in the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bladder pathways following acute and chronic irritation of the urinary tract of the rat. Chemical cystitis was induced by cyclophosphamide (CYP) which is metabolized to acrolein, an irritant eliminated in the urine. Injection of CYP (n = 10, 75 mg/kg, i.p.) 2 hours prior to perfusion (acute treatment) of the animals increased Fos-immunoreactivity (IR) in neurons in the dorsal commissure, dorsal horn, and autonomic regions of spinal segments (L1-L2 and L6-S1) which receive afferent inputs from the bladder, urethra, and ureter. Fos-IR in the spinal cord was not changed in rats receiving chronic CYP treatment (n = 15, 75 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd day for 2 weeks). In control animals and in animals treated acutely with CYP, only small numbers of NOS-IR cells (0.5-0.7 cell profiles/sections) were detected in the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Chronic CYP administration significantly (P < or = .002) increased bladder weight by 60% and increased (7- to 11-fold) the numbers of NOS-immunoreactive (IR) afferent neurons in the L6-S1 DRG. A small increase (1.5-fold) also occurred in the L1 DRG, but no change was detected in the L2 and L5 DRG. Bladder afferent cells in the L6-S1 DRG labeled by Fluorogold (40 microliters) injected into the bladder wall did not exhibit NOS-IR in control animals; however, following chronic CYP administration, a significant percentage of bladder afferent neurons were NOS-IR: L6 (19.8 +/- 4.6%) and S1 (25.3 +/- 2.9%). These results indicate that neuronal gene expression in visceral sensory pathways can be upregulated by chemical irritation of afferent receptors in the urinary tract and/or that pathological changes in the urinary tract can initiate chemical signals that alter the chemical properties of visceral afferent neurons.",0,0,1,0

"Effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy: behavioral and electrophysiological studies. OBJECTIVE: The globus pallidus plays a critical role in movement regulation. Previous studies have indicated that the globus pallidus receives neurotensinergic innervation from the striatum, and systemic administration of a neurotensin analog could produce antiparkinsonian effects. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of pallidal neurotensin on haloperidol-induced parkinsonian symptoms. METHODS: Behavioral experiments and electrophysiological recordings were performed in the present study. RESULTS: Bilateral infusions of neurotensin into the globus pallidus reversed haloperidol-induced parkinsonian catalepsy in rats. Electrophysiological recordings showed that microinjection of neurotensin induced excitation of pallidal neurons in the presence of systemic haloperidol administration. The neurotensin type-1 receptor antagonist SR48692 blocked both the behavioral and the electrophysiological effects induced by neurotensin.

"Effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dogs. BACKGROUND: Atrial tachycardia-induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF) and decreases L-type Ca(2+) current. There is also a clinical suggestion that acute L-type Ca(2) channel blockade can promote AF, consistent with an AF promoting effect of Ca(2+) channel inhibition. METHODS: To evaluate the potential mechanisms of AF promotion by Ca(2+) channel blockers, we administered verapamil to morphine-chloralose anesthetized dogs. Diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nadolol was applied in some experiments. Epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during AF. RESULTS: Verapamil caused AF promotion in six dogs, increasing mean duration of AF induced by burst pacing, from 8+/-4 s (mean+/-S.E.) to 95+/-39 s (P<0.01 vs. control) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg/kg and 228+/-101 s (P<0.0005 vs. control) at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. Underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of verapamil. In these experiments, verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period (ERP) from 122+/-5 to 114+/-4 ms (P<0.02) at a cycle length of 300 ms, decreased ERP heterogeneity (from 15+/-1 to 10+/-1%, P<0.05), heterogeneously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of AF (94+/-4 to 84+/-3 ms, P<0.005). Diltiazem did not affect ERP, AF cycle length or AF duration, but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil (n=5). In the presence of autonomic blockade, verapamil failed to promote AF and increased, rather than decreasing, refractoriness. Neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic blockade. Epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted AF by increasing the number of simultaneous wavefronts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Verapamil promotes AF in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry, an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem.",1,0,1,0

"Effect of captopril on pre-existing and aminonucleoside-induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patients. The possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in SHR. Oral administration of captopril at 100 mg/kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre-existing in SHR. Also, captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria invoked by puromycin aminonucleoside in SHR. Captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations, excretion of urine, sodium and potassium, endogenous creatinine clearance, body weight, and food and water consumption. However, ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several lethalities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in SHR.",0,1,0,0
"Correlation between the location of germ-line mutations in the APC gene and the number of colorectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis patients. Recently we have isolated the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene which causes familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , and its germ-line mutations in a substantial number of FAP patients have been identified . On the basis of this information , we compared the location of germ-line mutations in the APC gene in 22 unrelated patients ( 12 of whom have been reported previously ) with the number of colorectal polyps developed in FAP patients ; 17 were sparse types and five were profuse types . All but one of the mutations were considered to cause truncation of the gene product by frame-shift due to deletion ( 14 cases ) or nonsense mutation ( seven cases ) . The location of the germ-line mutations seems to correlate with the two clinical types ; germ-line mutations in five FAP patients with profuse polyps were observed between codon 1250 and codon 1464 , whereas mutations in 17 FAP patients with fewer polyps were observed in the other regions of the APC gene . The result suggests that the number of colorectal polyps in FAP patients may be associated with a difference in the stability or biological function of the truncated APC protein . .",0,0,1,0

"Clinical and genetic study of Friedreich ataxia in an Australian population. Friedreich ataxia is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the FRDA gene that encodes a 210-amino acid protein called frataxin . An expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in intron 1 of the gene is present in more than 95 % of mutant alleles . Of the 83 people we studied who have mutations in FRDA , 78 are homozygous for an expanded GAA repeat ; the other five patients have an expansion in one allele and a point mutation in the other . Here we present a detailed clinical and genetic study of a subset of 51 patients homozygous for an expansion of the GAA repeat . We found a correlation between the size of the smaller of the two expanded alleles and age at onset , age into wheelchair , scoliosis , impaired vibration sense , and the presence of foot deformity . There was no significant correlation between the size of the smaller allele and cardiomyopathy , diabetes mellitus , loss of proprioception , or bladder symptoms .

"Emerin, deficiency of which causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, is localized at the inner nuclear membrane. X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EDMD ) is an inherited muscle disorder characterized by the clinical triad of progressive wasting of humero-peroneal muscles , early contractures of the elbows , Achilles tendons and postcervical muscles , and cardiac conduction block with a high risk of sudden death . The gene for EDMD on Xq28 encodes a novel protein named emerin that localizes at the nuclear membrane of skeletal , cardiac and smooth muscles and some other non-muscle tissues . To investigate a possible physiological role for emerin , we examined the ultrastructural localization of the protein in human skeletal muscle and HeLa cells , using ultrathin cryosections . We found that the immune-labeled colloidal gold particles were localized on the nucleoplasmic surface of the inner nuclear membrane , but not on the nuclear pore . Emerin stayed on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear lamina , even after detergent treatment that solubilizes membrane lipids and washes out membrane proteins . These results suggest that emerin anchors at the inner nuclear membrane through the hydrophobic stretch , and protrudes from the hydrophilic region to the nucleoplasm where it interacts with the nuclear lamina . We speculate that emerin contributes to maintain the nuclear structure and stability , as well as nuclear functions , particularly in muscle tissues that have severe stress with rigorous contraction-relaxation movements and calcium flux . .",0,0,1,0
"Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium-induced chronic renal failure in rats. Rats with lithium-induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein (HP) feeding, uninephrectomy (NX) or a combination of these, in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure. Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium-containing diet (50 mmol/kg) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet, HP diet (40 vs. 19%), NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks. Corresponding non-lithium pretreated groups were generated. When comparing all lithium treated versus non-lithium-treated groups, lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow (as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules) or lithium clearance. Consequently, lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion. Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis. HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats. NX caused an additive deterioration in GFR which, however, was ameliorated by HP. NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li-pretreated rats. The results indicate that Li-induced nephropathy, even when the GFR is only modestly reduced, is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension. In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow, which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli. The fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced, leaving the distal delivery unchanged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",1,1,0,0

"High resolution genetic analysis suggests one ancestral predisposing haplotype for the origin of the myotonic dystrophy mutation. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as an amplification of an unstable trinucleotide ( CTG ) n repeat in over 99 % of the global DM population . It is in complete linkage disequilibrium with an Alu element polymorphism within the DM kinase gene , suggesting that DM is a consequence of one or few ancestral mutations . A recent analysis utilizing this polymorphism as well as a flanking dinucleotide marker , suggested that similar to Fragile X syndrome , DM exhibited a founder effect ( Imbert et al . , 1993 Nature Genet . 4 , 72-76 ) . In contrast , the low reproductive fitness of individuals with congenital DM ( the endpoint of genetic anticipation in myotonic dystrophy ) suggests a higher rate of new mutations . We present a high resolution genetic analysis of the DM locus using PCR based assays of nine polymorphisms , spanning a physical distance of 30 kb , within and immediately flanking the DM kinase gene . The persistent complete allelic association of the DM mutation with all these polymorphisms provides further support to previous observations and suggests more strongly that the DM mutation occurred on the background of a particular haplotype in which the ( CTG ) n repeat became inherently unstable and therefore predisposed to amplification .",0,0,1,0

"Frequent inactivation of PTEN/MMAC1 in primary prostate cancer. Sporadic prostate carcinoma is the most common male cancer in the Western world , yet many of the major genetic events involved in the progression of this often fatal cancer remain to be elucidated . Numerous cytogenetic and allelotype studies have reported frequent loss of heterozygosity on chromosomal arm 10q in sporadic prostate cancer . Deletion mapping studies have unambiguously identified a region of chromosome 10q23 to be the minimal area of loss . A new tumor suppressor gene , PTEN / MMAC1 , was isolated recently at this region of chromosome 10q23 and found to be inactivated by mutation in three prostate cancer cell lines . We screened 80 prostate tumors by microsatellite analysis and found chromosome 10q23 to be deleted in 23 cases . We then proceeded with sequence analysis of the entire PTEN / MMAC1 coding region and tested for homozygous deletion with new intragenic markers in these 23 cases with 10q23 loss of heterozygosity .

"Epidural blood flow during prostaglandin E1 or trimethaphan induced hypotension. To evaluate the effect of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) or trimethaphan (TMP) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow (EBF) during spinal surgery, EBF was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent postero-lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaesthesia. An initial dose of 0.1 microgram.kg-1.min-1 of PGE1 (15 patients), or 10 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 of TMP (15 patients) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) at about 60 mmHg. The hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative procedure. After starting PGE1 or TMP, MAP and rate pressure product (RPP) decreased significantly compared with preinfusion values (P < 0.01), and the degree of hypotension due to PGE1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinuation. Heart rate (HR) did not change in either group. EBFF did not change during PGE1 infusion whereas in the TMP group, EBF decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of TMP (preinfusion: 45.9 +/- 13.9 ml/100g/min. 30 min: 32.3 +/- 9.9 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05). 60 min: 30 +/- 7.5 ml/100 g/min (P < 0.05)).

"Spectrum of adverse events after generic HAART in southern Indian HIV-infected patients. To determine the incidence of clinically significant adverse events after long-term, fixed-dose, generic highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) use among HIV-infected individuals in South India, we examined the experiences of 3154 HIV-infected individuals who received a minimum of 3 months of generic HAART between February 1996 and December 2006 at a tertiary HIV care referral center in South India. The most common regimens were 3TC + d4T + nevirapine (NVP) (54.8%), zidovudine (AZT) + 3TC + NVP (14.5%), 3TC + d4T + efavirenz (EFV) (20.1%), and AZT + 3TC + EFV (5.4%). The most common adverse events and median CD4 at time of event were rash (15.2%; CD4, 285 cells/microL) and peripheral neuropathy (9.0% and 348 cells/microL). Clinically significant anemia (hemoglobin <7 g/dL) was observed in 5.4% of patients (CD4, 165 cells/microL) and hepatitis (clinical jaundice with alanine aminotransferase > 5 times upper limits of normal) in 3.5% of patients (CD4, 260 cells/microL). Women were significantly more likely to experience lactic acidosis, while men were significantly more likely to experience immune reconstitution syndrome (p < 0.05).

"Flumazenil induces seizures and death in mixed cocaine-diazepam intoxications. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Administration of the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil may unmask seizures in mixed cocaine-benzodiazepine intoxication. DESIGN: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received 100 mg/kg cocaine IP alone, 5 mg/kg diazepam alone, or a combination of diazepam and cocaine. Three minutes later, groups were challenged with vehicle or flumazenil 5 or 10 mg/kg IP. Animal behavior, seizures (time to and incidence), death (time to and incidence), and cortical EEG tracings were recorded. INTERVENTIONS: Administration of flumazenil to animals after they had received a combination dose of cocaine and diazepam. RESULTS: In group 1, animals received cocaine followed by vehicle. This resulted in 100% developing seizures and death. Group 2 received diazepam alone followed by vehicle. Animals became somnolent and none died. Group 3 received diazepam followed by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. Animals became somnolent after diazepam and then active after flumazenil administration. In group 4, a combination of cocaine and diazepam was administered simultaneously. This resulted in no overt or EEG-detectable seizures and a 50% incidence of death. Group 5 received a similar combination of cocaine and diazepam, followed later by 5 mg/kg flumazenil. This resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < .01), and death, 100% (P < or = .01), compared with group 4. Group 6 received cocaine and diazepam followed by 10 mg/kg flumazenil. This also resulted in an increased incidence of seizures, 90% (P < or = .01), and death, 90% (P < or = .05), compared with group 4. CONCLUSION: Flumazenil can unmask seizures and increase the incidence of death in a model of combined cocaine-diazepam intoxications.",0,0,1,0
"Relation of perfusion defects observed with myocardial contrast echocardiography to the severity of coronary stenosis: correlation with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography. It has been previously shown that myocardial contrast echocardiography is a valuable technique for delineating regions of myocardial underperfusion secondary to coronary occlusion and to critical coronary stenoses in the presence of hyperemic stimulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether myocardial contrast echocardiography performed with a stable solution of sonicated albumin could detect regions of myocardial underperfusion resulting from various degrees of coronary stenosis. The perfusion defect produced in 16 open chest dogs was compared with the anatomic area at risk measured by the postmortem dual-perfusion technique and with thallium-201 single-photon emission tomography (SPECT). During a transient (20-s) coronary occlusion, a perfusion defect was observed with contrast echocardiography in 14 of the 15 dogs in which the occlusion was produced. The perfusion defect correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.74; p less than 0.002). During dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, 12 of the 16 dogs with a partial coronary stenosis had a visible area of hypoperfusion by contrast echocardiography. The four dogs without a perfusion defect had a stenosis that resulted in a mild (0% to 50%) reduction in dipyridamole-induced hyperemia. The size of the perfusion defect during stenosis correlated significantly with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.61; p = 0.02). Thallium-201 SPECT demonstrated a perfusion defect in all 14 dogs analyzed during dipyridamole-induced hyperemia; the size of the perfusion defect correlated with the anatomic area at risk (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03) and with the perfusion defect by contrast echocardiography (r = 0.58; p less than 0.03). Thus, myocardial contrast echocardiography can be used to visualize and quantitate the amount of jeopardized myocardium during moderate to severe degrees of coronary stenosis. The results obtained show a correlation with the anatomic area at risk similar to that obtained with thallium-201 SPECT.",1,0,0,0
"Definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis C virus. Chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. The current best treatment for HCV infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of patients, it can be associated with a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. Hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can be problematic in patients with HCV infection, especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular disorders. In general, anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality, and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of life. Although ribavirin-associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin-associated anemia but has other potential disadvantages. Viramidine, a liver-targeting prodrug of ribavirin, has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",1,1,0,1

"Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-imidazoline receptor-mediated hypotension in female rats. We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine (mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction. The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and/or I1-receptors. Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine (600 microg/kg) or alpha-methyldopa (100 mg/kg), selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists, respectively, in blood pressure, hemodynamic variability, and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham-operated and ovariectomized (Ovx) Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement. Three time domain indexes of hemodynamic variability were employed: the standard deviation of mean arterial pressure as a measure of blood pressure variability and the standard deviation of beat-to-beat intervals (SDRR) and the root mean square of successive differences in R-wave-to-R-wave intervals as measures of heart rate variability. In sham-operated rats, rilmenidine or alpha-methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure. SDRR was reduced only by alpha-methyldopa. Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha-methyldopa, in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension. The enhanced alpha-methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity. Estrogen replacement (17beta-estradiol subcutaneous pellet, 14.2 microg/day, 12 wk) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha-methyldopa to sham-operated levels. These findings suggest that estrogen downregulates alpha2- but not I1-receptor-mediated hypotension and highlight a role for the cardiac autonomic control in alpha-methyldopa-estrogen interaction.",1,0,0,0
"Genetic heterogeneity and penetrance analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in breast cancer families. The Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium. The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to inherited breast cancer was assessed by linkage and mutation analysis in 237 families , each with at least four cases of breast cancer , collected by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium . Families were included without regard to the occurrence of ovarian or other cancers . Overall , disease was linked to BRCA1 in an estimated 52 % of families , to BRCA2 in 32 % of families , and to neither gene in 16 % ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 6 % -28 % ) , suggesting other predisposition genes . The majority ( 81 % ) of the breast-ovarian cancer families were due to BRCA1 , with most others ( 14 % ) due to BRCA2 . Conversely , the majority of families with male and female breast cancer were due to BRCA2 ( 76 % ) . The largest proportion ( 67 % ) of families due to other genes was found in families with four or five cases of female breast cancer only . These estimates were not substantially affected either by changing the assumed penetrance model for BRCA1 or by including or excluding BRCA1 mutation data . Among those families with disease due to BRCA1 that were tested by one of the standard screening methods , mutations were detected in the coding sequence or splice sites in an estimated 63 % ( 95 % CI 51 % -77 % ) . The estimated sensitivity was identical for direct sequencing and other techniques . The penetrance of BRCA2 was estimated by maximizing the LOD score in BRCA2-mutation families , over all possible penetrance functions . The estimated cumulative risk of breast cancer reached 28 % ( 95 % CI 9 % -44 % ) by age 50 years and 84 % ( 95 % CI 43 % -95 % ) by age 70 years . The corresponding ovarian cancer risks were 0 . 4 % ( 95 % CI 0 % -1 % ) by age 50 years and 27 % ( 95 % CI 0 % -47 % ) by age 70 years .

"Central excitatory actions of flurazepam. Toxic actions of flurazepam (FZP) were studied in cats, mice and rats. High doses caused an apparent central excitation, most clearly seen as clonic convulsions, superimposed on general depression. Following a lethal dose, death was always associated with convulsions. Comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness, while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory actions. Signs of FZP toxocity in cats included excessive salivation, extreme apprehensive behavior, retching, muscle tremors and convulsions. An interaction between FZP and pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) was shown by pretreating mice with FZP before PTZ challenge. As a function of dose, FZP first protected against convulsions and death. At higher doses, however, convulsions again emerged. These doses of FZP were lower than those that would alone cause convulsions. These results may be relevant to the use of FZP in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability, such as epilepsy or sedative-hypnotic drug withdrawal.",0,0,1,0

"The 5' end of the BRCA1 gene lies within a duplicated region of human chromosome 17q21. To begin to address the hypothesis that abnormal regulation of the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is a critical step in sporadic breast / ovarian tumorigenesis , we have determined the detailed structure of the BRCA1 genomic region . We show that this region of the genome contains a tandem duplication of approximately 30 kilobases , which results in two copies of BRCA1 exons 1 and 2 , of exons 1 and 3 of the adjacent 1A1-3B gene and of the previously reported 295 base pair intergenic region . Sequence analysis of the duplicated exons of BRCA1 and 1A1-3B and flanking genomic DNA reveals maintenance of the intron-exon structure and a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity , suggesting that these are non-processed pseudogenes and that the duplication is a recent event in evolutionary terms . We also show that a processed pseudogene of the acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P1 ( ARPP1 ) is inserted directly upstream of pseudo-BRCA1 exon 1A . We believe that these findings could not only confound BRCA1 mutation analysis , but could have implications for the normal and abnormal regulation of BRCA1 transcription , translation and function . .",0,0,1,1

METHODS: Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke (within 24 hours) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo (n=100), 1 mg/h (low-dose) nimodipine (n=101), or 2 mg/h (high-dose) nimodipine (n=94). The correlation between average BP change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analyzed. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-five patients were included in this analysis (n=92, 93, and 80 for placebo, low dose, and high dose, respectively). Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days. In multivariate analysis, a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high-dose group (beta=0.49, P=0. 048). Patients with a DBP reduction of > or =20% in the high-dose group had a significantly increased adjusted OR for the compound outcome variable death or dependency (Barthel Index <60) (n/N=25/26, OR 10. 16, 95% CI 1.02 to 101.74) and death alone (n/N=9/26, OR 4.336, 95% CI 1.131 16.619) compared with all placebo patients (n/N=62/92 and 14/92, respectively). There was no correlation between SBP change and outcome. CONCLUSIONS: DBP, but not SBP, reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high-dose nimodipine after acute stroke. For low-dose nimodipine, the results were not conclusive. These results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine.",1,0,1,0
"Efficacy and safety of asenapine in a placebo- and haloperidol-controlled trial in patients with acute exacerbation of schizophrenia. Asenapine is approved by the Food and Drugs Administration in adults for acute treatment of schizophrenia or of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder with or without psychotic features. In a double-blind 6-week trial, 458 patients with acute schizophrenia were randomly assigned to fixed-dose treatment with asenapine at 5 mg twice daily (BID), asenapine at 10 mg BID, placebo, or haloperidol at 4 mg BID (to verify assay sensitivity). With last observations carried forward (LOCF), mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale total score reductions from baseline to endpoint were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 mg BID (-16.2) and haloperidol (-15.4) than placebo (-10.7; both P < 0.05); using mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM), changes at day 42 were significantly greater with asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID (-21.3 and -19.4, respectively) and haloperidol (-20.0) than placebo (-14.6; all P < 0.05). On the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, all treatments were superior to placebo with LOCF and MMRM; asenapine at 5 mg BID was superior to placebo on the negative subscale with MMRM and on the general psychopathology subscale with LOCF and MMRM. Treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 44% and 52%, 57%, and 41% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Extrapyramidal symptoms reported as AEs occurred in 15% and 18%, 34%, and 10% of the asenapine at 5 and 10 mg BID, haloperidol, and placebo groups, respectively. Across all groups, no more than 5% of patients had clinically significant weight change. Post hoc analyses indicated that efficacy was similar with asenapine and haloperidol; greater contrasts were seen in AEs, especially extrapyramidal symptoms.",0,0,1,0
"Butyrylcholinesterase gene mutations in patients with prolonged apnea after succinylcholine for electroconvulsive therapy. BACKGROUND: patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) often receive succinylcholine as part of the anesthetic procedure. The duration of action may be prolonged in patients with genetic variants of the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme (BChE), the most common being the K- and the A-variants. The aim of the study was to assess the clinical significance of genetic variants in butyrylcholinesterase gene (BCHE) in patients with a suspected prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine after ECT. METHODS: a total of 13 patients were referred to the Danish Cholinesterase Research Unit after ECT during 38 months. We determined the BChE activity and the BCHE genotype using molecular genetic methods, the duration of apnea, time to sufficient spontaneous ventilation and whether neuromuscular monitoring was used. The duration of apnea was compared with published data on normal subjects. RESULTS: in 11 patients, mutations were found in the BCHE gene, the K-variant being the most frequent. The duration of apnea was 5-15 min compared with 3-5.3 min from the literature. Severe distress was noted in the recovery phase in two patients. Neuromuscular monitoring was used in two patients. CONCLUSION: eleven of 13 patients with a prolonged duration of action of succinylcholine had mutations in BCHE, indicating that this is the possible reason for a prolonged period of apnea. We recommend objective neuromuscular monitoring during the first ECT.",0,0,1,0

"Utilization of purines by an HPRT variant in an intelligent, nonmutilative patient with features of the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient , H . Chr .

C . 2 . 4 . 2 . 8 ) distinct from the enzyme present in patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome . The patient had chroeoathetosis , spasticity , dysarthric speech , and hyperuricemia . However , his intelligence was normal and he had no evidence of self-mutilation . There was no activity of HPRT in the lysates of erythrocytes and cultured fibroblasts when analyzed in the usual manner . Using a newly developed method for the study of purine metabolism in intact cultured cells , this patient was found to metabolize some 9 % of 8-14C-hypoxanthine , and 90 % of the isotope utilized was converted to adenine and guanine nucleotides . In contrast , cells from patients with the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome were virtually completely unable to convert hypoxanthine to nucleotides . The patients fibroblasts were even more efficient in the metabolism of 8-14C-guanine , which was utilized to the extent of 27 % , over 80 % of which was converted to guanine and adenine nucleotides . The growth of the cultured fibroblasts of this patient was intermediate in media containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine ( HAT ) , whereas the growth of Lesch-Nyhan cells was inhibited and normal cells grew normally . Similarly in 8-azaguanine , 6-thioguanine , and 8-azahypoxanthine , the growth of the patients cells was intermediate between normal and Lesch-Nyhan cells . These observations provide further evidence for genetic heterogeneity among patients with disorders in purine metabolism involving the HPRT gene .

"Yeast artificial chromosomes for the molecular analysis of the familial polyposis APC gene region. Two yeast artificial chromosomes ( YACs ) spanning a total distance of 1 . 1 megabase pairs of DNA around the MCC ( for mutated in colorectal carcinoma ) and APC ( for adenomatous polyposis coli ) genes at 5q21 have been isolated and characterized . Starting from the MCC gene , a strategy was undertaken to identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions in familial adenomatous polyposis patients that might considerably narrow down the position of the APC gene . To this end , YACs identified by the MCC gene were screened across a chromosome 5-specific cosmid library to provide a source of DNA probes for genomic scanning . The cosmids isolated from these experiments were used to screen a panel of somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated from patients suspected to carry putative interstitial deletions . This screening approach led to the confirmation of a small heterozygous deletion in a polyposis patient that overlaps one of the two isolated YACs . This YAC has been shown to contain the entire APC gene , in addition to a significant portion of DNA flanking the 5 end of the gene , and should therefore prove a valuable resource for functional studies by transfer to colorectal tumor-derived cell lines .",0,0,0,1

"Haplotype and phenotype analysis of six recurrent BRCA1 mutations in 61 families: results of an international study. Several BRCA1 mutations have now been found to occur in geographically diverse breast and ovarian cancer families . To investigate mutation origin and mutation-specific phenotypes due to BRCA1 , we constructed a haplotype of nine polymorphic markers within or immediately flanking the BRCA1 locus in a set of 61 breast / ovarian cancer families selected for having one of six recurrent BRCA1 mutations . Tests of both mutations and family-specific differences in age at diagnosis were not significant . A comparison of the six mutations in the relative proportions of cases of breast and ovarian cancer was suggestive of an effect ( P = . 069 ) , with 57 % of women presumed affected because of the 1294 del 40 BRCA1 mutation having ovarian cancer , compared with 14 % of affected women with the splice-site mutation in intron 5 of BRCA1 . For the BRCA1 mutations studied here , the individual mutations are estimated to have arisen 9-170 generations ago . In general , a high degree of haplotype conservation across the region was observed , with haplotype differences most often due to mutations in the short-tandem-repeat markers , although some likely instances of recombination also were observed . For several of the instances , there was evidence for multiple , independent , BRCA1 mutational events .",0,0,0,1
"Somatic mutations of the APC gene in colorectal tumors: mutation cluster region in the APC gene. We examined somatic mutations of the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) gene in 63 colorectal tumors ( 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas ) developed in familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) and non-FAP patients . In addition to loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) at the APC locus in 30 tumors , 43 other somatic mutations were detected . Twenty-one of them were point mutations ; 16 nonsense and two missense mutations , and three occurred in introns at the splicing site . Twenty-two tumors had frameshift mutations due to deletion or insertion ; nineteen of them were deletions of one to 31 bp and three were a 1-bp insertion . One tumor had a 1-bp deletion in an intron near the splicing site . Hence , 41 ( 95 % ) of 43 mutations resulted in truncation of the APC protein . Over 60 % of the somatic mutations in the APC gene were clustered within a small region of exon 15 , designated as MCR ( mutation cluster region ) , which accounted for less than 10 % of the coding region . Combining these data and the results of LOH , more than 80 % of tumors ( 14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas ) had at least one mutation in the APC gene , of which more than 60 % ( 9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas ) had two mutations . These results strongly suggest that somatic mutations of the APC gene are associated with development of a great majority of colorectal tumors . .",0,0,0,1

"Chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non-small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel: a phase II trial. Paclitaxel (Taxol; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Princeton, NJ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types, notably ovarian and breast carcinoma. Two phase II trials of 24-hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) reported response rates of 21% and 24%. Leukopenia was dose limiting: as many as 62.5% of patients experienced grade 4 leukopenia. We investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase II trial in patients with inoperable stage IIIB or IV NSCLC. The 58 patients treated (41 men and 17 women) had a median age of 59 years (age range, 25 to 75) and a performance status of 0 through 2. Most patients (72.4%) had stage IV NSCLC. Paclitaxel 225 mg/m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic premedication. Of 50 patients evaluable for response, 12 (24%) had partial remission, 26 (52%) had no change, and 12 had disease progression (24%). Hematologic toxicities were mild: only one patient (2%) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, while 29% had grade 1 or 2. Grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56% of patients while only one (2%) experienced severe polyneuropathy. Similarly, grade 1 or 2 myalgia/arthralgia was observed in 63.2% of patients, but only 14.3% experienced grade 3 or 4. Nausea and vomiting were infrequent, with 14% of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2% experiencing grade 3 or 4. Paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population, with a 3-hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24-hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity. Further phase II studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against NSCLC are indicated, and phase III studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed.",0,0,1,1

"The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and X-linked congenital thrombocytopenia are caused by mutations of the same gene. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia , small platelets , eczema , recurrent infections , and immunodeficiency . Besides the classic WAS phenotype , there is a group of patients with congenital X-linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) who have small platelets but only transient eczema , if any , and minimal immune deficiency . Because the gene responsible for WAS has been sequenced , it was possible to correlate the WAS phenotypes with WAS gene mutations . Using a fingerprinting screening technique , we determined the approximate location of the mutation in 13 unrelated WAS patients with mild to severe clinical symptoms . Direct sequence analysis of cDNA and genomic DNA obtained from patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout the WAS gene , including insertions , deletions , and point mutations resulting in amino acid substitutions , termination , exon skipping , or splicing defects . Of 4 unrelated patients with the XLT phenotype , 3 had missense mutations affecting exon 2 and 1 had a splice-site mutation affecting exon 9 . Patients with classic WAS had more complex mutations , resulting in termination codons , frameshift , and early termination . These findings provide direct evidence that XLT and WAS are caused by mutations of the same gene and suggest that severe clinical phenotypes are associated with complex mutations . .",0,0,1,0
"Association of BRCA1 with the hRad50-hMre11-p95 complex and the DNA damage response. BRCA1 encodes a tumor suppressor that is mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers . Here , it is shown that BRCA1 interacts in vitro and in vivo with hRad50 , which forms a complex with hMre11 and p95 / nibrin . Upon irradiation , BRCA1 was detected in discrete foci in the nucleus , which colocalize with hRad50 . Formation of irradiation-induced foci positive for BRCA1 , hRad50 , hMre11 , or p95 was dramatically reduced in HCC / 1937 breast cancer cells carrying a homozygous mutation in BRCA1 but was restored by transfection of wild-type BRCA1 . Ectopic expression of wild-type , but not mutated , BRCA1 in these cells rendered them less sensitive to the DNA damage agent , methyl methanesulfonate .

"Reducing harm associated with anticoagulation: practical considerations of argatroban therapy in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Argatroban is a hepatically metabolized, direct thrombin inhibitor used for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and for patients with or at risk of HIT undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT. The US FDA-recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg/kg/min (reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients), adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) 1.5-3 times baseline (not >100 seconds). Contemporary experiences indicate that reduced doses are also needed in patients with conditions associated with hepatic hypoperfusion, e.g. heart failure, yet are unnecessary for renal dysfunction, adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity. Argatroban 0.5-1.2 microg/kg/min typically supports therapeutic aPTTs. The FDA-recommended dose during PCI is 25 microg/kg/min (350 microg/kg initial bolus), adjusted to achieve activated clotting times (ACTs) of 300-450 sec. For PCI, argatroban has not been investigated in hepatically impaired patients; dose adjustment is unnecessary for adult age, sex, race/ethnicity or obesity, and lesser doses may be adequate with concurrent glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Argatroban prolongs the International Normalized Ratio, and published approaches for monitoring the argatroban-to-warfarin transition should be followed. Major bleeding with argatroban is 0-10% in the non-interventional setting and 0-5.8% periprocedurally. Argatroban has no specific antidote, and if excessive anticoagulation occurs, argatroban infusion should be stopped or reduced. Improved familiarity of healthcare professionals with argatroban therapy in HIT, including in special populations and during PCI, may facilitate reduction of harm associated with HIT (e.g. fewer thromboses) or its treatment (e.g. fewer argatroban medication errors).",1,1,0,0

"Comparison of valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide combination therapy at doses up to 320/25 mg versus monotherapy: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by long-term combination therapy in hypertensive adults. BACKGROUND: One third of patients treated for hypertension attain adequate blood pressure (BP) control, and multidrug regimens are often required. Given the lifelong nature of hypertension, there is a need to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of higher doses of combination anti-hypertensive therapies. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the efficacy and tolerability of valsartan (VAL) or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-monotherapy and higher-dose combinations in patients with essential hypertension. METHODS: The first part of this study was an 8-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group trial. Patients with essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic BP [MSDBP], > or =95 mm Hg and <110 mm Hg) were randomized to 1 of 8 treatment groups: VAL 160 or 320 mg; HCTZ 12.5 or 25 mg; VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5, 320/12.5, or 320/25 mg; or placebo. Mean changes in MSDBP and mean sitting systolic BP (MSSBP) were analyzed at the 8-week core study end point. VAL/HCTZ 320/12.5 and 320/25 mg were further investigated in a 54-week, open-label extension. Response was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg or a > or =10 mm Hg decrease compared to baseline. Control was defined as MSDBP <90 mm Hg compared with baseline. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring adverse events at randomization and all subsequent study visits and regular evaluation of hematology and blood chemistry. RESULTS: A total of 1346 patients were randomized into the 8-week core study (734 men, 612 women; 924 white, 291 black, 23 Asian, 108 other; mean age, 52.7 years; mean weight, 92.6 kg). All active treatments were associated with significantly reduced MSSBP and MSDBP during the core 8-week study, with each monotherapy significantly contributing to the overall effect of combination therapy (VAL and HCTZ, P < 0.001). Each combination was associated with significantly greater reductions in MSSBP and MSDBP compared with the monotherapies and placebo (all, P < 0.001). The mean reduction in MSSBP/MSDBP with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg was 24.7/16.6 mm Hg, compared with 5.9/7.0 mm Hg with placebo. The reduction in MSSBP was significantly greater with VAL/HCTZ 320/25 mg compared with VAL/HCTZ 160/12.5 mg (P < 0.002). Rates of response and BP control were significantly higher in the groups that received combination treatment compared with those that received monotherapy. The incidence of hypokalemia was lower with VAL/HCTZ combinations (1.8%-6.1%) than with HCTZ monotherapies (7.1%-13.3%). The majority of adverse events in the core study were of mild to moderate severity. The efficacy and tolerability of VAL/HCTZ combinations were maintained during the extension (797 patients). CONCLUSIONS: In this study population, combination therapies with VAL/HCTZ were associated with significantly greater BP reductions compared with either monotherapy, were well tolerated, and were associated with less hypokalemia than HCTZ alone.",1,0,1,0

"Neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxyquinolines: clinical analysis of cases reported outside Japan. An analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxyquinolines reported from outside Japan. In 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of clioquinol could be excluded. Of the remainder, a relationship to clioquinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cases. In six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of clioquinol over a short period. The most common manifestation, observed in 15 further cases, was isolated optic atrophy. This was most frequently found in children, many of whom had received clioquinol as treatment for acrodermatitis enteropathica. In the remaining cases, a combination of myelopathy, visual disturbance, and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifestation. Isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy, or these manifestations occurring together, were infrequent. The onset of all manifestations (except toxic encephalopathy) was usually subacute, with subsequent partial recovery. Older subjects tended to display more side effects. The full syndrome of subacute myelo-optic neuropathy was more frequent in women, but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug.",0,0,1,0
"Reduced sodium channel density, altered voltage dependence of inactivation, and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2-subunits. Sodium channel beta-subunits modulate channel gating, assembly, and cell surface expression in heterologous cell systems. We generated beta2(-/-) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density, localization, and function in neurons in vivo. Measurements of [(3)H]saxitoxin (STX) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2(-/-) neurons. The loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neurons. The integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced, and the threshold for action potential generation was increased, indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium channels. In contrast, the conduction velocity, the number and size of axons in the optic nerve, and the specific localization of Na(v)1.6 channels in the nodes of Ranvier were unchanged. beta2(-/-) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures, as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures, but seemed normal in other neurological tests. Our observations show that beta2-subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability.",0,0,1,0
"Mutations in the gene for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with different clinical phenotypes. Recently , the gene for the most common peroxisomal disorder , X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy ( X-ALD ) , has been described encoding a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein . We analyzed the entire protein-coding sequence of this gene by reverse-transcription PCR , SSCP , and DNA sequencing in five patients with different clinical expression of X-ALD and in their female relatives ; these clinical expressions were cerebral childhood ALD , adrenomyeloneuropathy ( AMN ) , and "" Addison disease only "" ( ADO ) phenotype . In the three patients exhibiting the classical picture of severe childhood ALD we identified in the 5 portion of the X-ALD gene a 38-bp deletion that causes a frameshift mutation , a 3-bp deletion leading to a deletion of an amino acid in the ATP-binding domain of the ALD protein , and a missense mutation . In the patient with the clinical phenotype of AMN , a nonsense mutation in codon 212 , along with a second site mutation at codon 178 , was observed . Analysis of the patient with the ADO phenotype revealed a further missense mutation at a highly conserved position in the ALDP / PMP70 comparison . The disruptive nature of two mutations ( i . e . , the frameshift and the nonsense mutation ) in patients with biochemically proved childhood ALD and AMN further strongly supports the hypothesis that alterations in this gene play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of X-ALD .

"The DCC protein and prognosis in colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND  Allelic loss of chromosome 18q predicts a poor outcome in patients with stage II colorectal cancer . Although the specific gene inactivated by this allelic loss has not been elucidated , the DCC ( deleted in colorectal cancer ) gene is a candidate . We investigated whether the expression of the DCC protein in tumor cells is a prognostic marker in colorectal carcinoma . METHODS  The expression of DCC was evaluated immunohistochemically in 132 paraffin-embedded samples from patients with curatively resected stage II and III colorectal carcinomas . The Cox proportional-hazards model was used to adjust for covariates including age , sex , tumor site , degree of tumor differentiation , and use of adjuvant therapy . RESULTS  The expression of DCC was a strong positive predictive factor for survival in both stage II and stage III colorectal carcinomas . In patients with stage II disease whose tumors expressed DCC , the five-year survival rate was 94 . 3 percent , whereas in patients with DCC-negative tumors , the survival rate was 61 . 6 percent ( P stage III disease , the respective survival rates were 59 . 3 percent and 33 . 2 percent ( P = 0 . 03 ) . CONCLUSIONS  DCC is a prognostic marker in patients with stage II or stage III colorectal cancer . In stage II colorectal carcinomas , the absence of DCC identifies a subgroup of patients with lesions that behave like stage III cancers . These findings may thus have therapeutic implications in this group of patients",0,0,0,1

"Duplicational mutation at the Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus: its frequency, distribution, origin, and phenotypegenotype correlation. Partial gene deletion is the major cause of mutation leading to Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) and Becker muscular dystrophy ( BMD ) . Partial gene duplication has also been recognized in a few cases . We have conducted a survey for duplication in 72 unrelated nondeletion patients , analyzed by Southern blot hybridization with clones representing the entire DMD cDNA . With careful quantitative analysis of hybridization band intensity , 10 cases were found to carry a duplication of part of the gene , a frequency of 14 % for nondeletion cases ( 10 / 72 ) , or 6 % for all cases ( 10 / 181 ) . The extent of these duplications has been characterized according to the published exon-containing HindIII fragment map , and in six of the 10 duplications a novel restriction fragment that spanned the duplication junction was detected . The resulting translational reading frame of mRNA has been predicted for nine duplications . A shift of the reading frame was predicted in four of the six DMD cases and in one of the two intermediate cases , while the reading frame remained uninterrupted in both BMD cases . RFLP and quantitative Southern blot analyses revealed a grandpaternal origin of duplication in four families and grandmaternal origin in one family . In all five families , the duplication was found to originate from a single X chromosome . Unequal sister-chromatid exchange is proposed to be the mechanism for the formation of these duplications . .",0,0,1,0

"BRCA1 interacts with components of the histone deacetylase complex. Germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor-suppressor gene are associated with an increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer . BRCA1 contains a carboxyl-terminal domain ( BRCT ) that is shared with several other proteins involved in maintaining genome integrity . In an effort to understand the function of BRCA1 , we sought to isolate proteins that interact with the BRCT domain . Purified BRCT polypeptide was used as a probe to screen a human placenta cDNA expression library by Far Western analysis . Here we report that BRCA1 interacts in vivo and in vitro with the Rb-binding proteins , RbAp46 and RbAp48 , as well as with Rb . Moreover , the BRCT domain associates with the histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 .

"Optimising stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62%, and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22%. Overall, in high-risk patients, warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes, with a relative risk reduction of 36%. Ximelagatran, an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, was found to be as efficient as vitamin K antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events, but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function tests. The ACTIVE-W (Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial with Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) in the prevention af embolic events. Idraparinux, a Factor Xa inhibitor, is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrillation. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor-blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac remodelling.

"Germline BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of ovarian cancer cases. The objective of this study was to provide more accurate frequency estimates of breast cancer susceptibility gene 1 ( BRCA1 ) germline alterations in the ovarian cancer population . To achieve this , we determined the prevalence of BRCA1 alterations in a population-based series of consecutive ovarian cancer cases . This is the first population-based ovarian cancer study reporting BRCA1 alterations derived from a comprehensive screen of the entire coding region . One hundred and seven ovarian cancer cases were analyzed for BRCA1 alterations using the RNase mismatch cleavage assay followed by direct sequencing . Two truncating mutations , 962del4 and 3600del11 , were identified . Both patients had a family history of breast or ovarian cancer . Several novel as well as previously reported uncharacterized variants were also identified , some of which were associated with a family history of cancer . The frequency distribution of common polymorphisms was determined in the 91 Caucasian cancer cases in this series and 24 sister controls using allele-specific amplification . The rare form of the Q356R polymorphism was significantly ( P = 0 . 03 ) associated with a family history of ovarian cancer , suggesting that this polymorphism may influence ovarian cancer risk .

We report herein the occurrence of three separate phenotypes within a single family with a novel 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin / RDS gene . DESIGN  Case reports with clinical features , fluorescein angiography , kinetic perimetry , electrophysiological studies , and molecular genetics . SETTING  University medical centers . PATIENTS  A 75-year-old woman , her two daughters ( aged 44 and 50 years ) , and her 49-year-old son were screened for peripherin / RDS mutations because of the presence of multiple phenotypes within the same family . RESULTS  The mother presented at age 63 years with a profoundly abnormal electroretinogram ( ERG ) and adult-onset retinitis pigmentosa that progressed dramatically over 12 years , with marked loss of peripheral visual field . One daughter developed pattern macular dystrophy at age 31 years . At age 44 years , her ERG was moderately abnormal but her clinical disease was limited to the macula . Another daughter presented at age 42 years with macular degeneration and over 10 years developed the clinical picture of fundus flavimaculatus . Her peripheral visual field was preserved but her ERG was moderately abnormal . The son had onset of macular degeneration at age 44 years . Pericentral scotomas were present and the ERG was markedly abnormal . Fluorescein angiography revealed punctate pigment epithelial transmission defects . CONCLUSIONS  A 3-base pair deletion of codon 153 or 154 of the peripherin / RDS gene can produce clinically disparate phenotypes even within the same family . .",0,0,1,0

After discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyridoxine. A placebo had no effect, but niacinamide was as effective as pyridoxine. Periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyperkinesis. The level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relapse.

"Over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen-induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen-initiated tumor angiogenesis. Estrogens, which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers, can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of Fischer 344 rats. The mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction, during estrogen carcinogenesis, are still unknown. To elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats, the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was examined by Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol (E2) induces neovascularization, as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of exposure. The high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicate that the elevation of VEGF protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. After 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression, in the non-endothelial cell population, sharply declined and was restricted to the blood vessels. The function of non-endothelial-derived VEGF is not clear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR), expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure. These findings suggest that over expression of VEGF and its receptor (VEGFR-2) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary.",0,0,0,1

"Reversible inferior colliculus lesion in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy: magnetic resonance findings on diffusion-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging. OBJECTIVE: This is to present reversible inferior colliculus lesions in metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, to focus on the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From November 2005 to September 2007, 8 patients (5 men and 3 women) were diagnosed as having metronidazole-induced encephalopathy (age range; 43-78 years). They had been taking metronidazole (total dosage, 45-120 g; duration, 30 days to 2 months) to treat the infection in various organs. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were obtained after the hospitalization, including DWI (8/8), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map (4/8), FLAIR (7/8), and T2-weighted image (8/8). Follow-up MRIs were performed on 5 patients from third to 14th days after discontinuation of metronidazole administration. Findings of initial and follow-up MRIs were retrospectively evaluated by 2 neuroradiologists by consensus, to analyze the presence of abnormal signal intensities, their locations, and signal changes on follow-up images. RESULTS: Initial MRIs showed abnormal high signal intensities on DWI and FLAIR (or T2-weighted image) at the dentate nucleus (8/8), inferior colliculus (6/8), corpus callosum (2/8), pons (2/8), medulla (1/8), and bilateral cerebral white matter (1/8). High-signal intensity lesions on DWI tended to show low signal intensity on ADC map (3/4), but in one patient, high signal intensity was shown at bilateral dentate nuclei on not only DWI but also ADC map. All the lesions in dentate, inferior colliculus, pons, and medullas had been resolved completely on follow-up MRIs in 5 patients, but in 1 patient of them, corpus callosal lesion persisted. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible inferior colliculus lesions could be considered as the characteristic for metronidazole-induced encephalopathy, next to the dentate nucleus involvement.",0,0,1,0

"Acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hypertension. Whether the vasoconstrictive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstrated. Thus, caffeine (3.3 mg/kg) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men (aged 20 to 35 years) selected after screening on 2 separate occasions. Borderline hypertensive men (n = 24) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure (BP) of 140 to 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP 90 to 99 mm Hg. Low-risk controls (n = 24) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening BP < 130/85 mm Hg. Participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12-hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols; this required a total of 4 laboratory visits. Caffeine-induced changes in diastolic BP were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls (+8.4 vs +3.8 mm Hg, p < 0.0001), and were attributable to larger changes in impedance-derived measures of systemic vascular resistance (+135 vs +45 dynes.s.cm-5, p < 0.004). These findings were consistent and reached significance in both protocols. The percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic BP changes exceeded the median control response was 96%. Consequently, whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting predrug baseline, 33% of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive BP levels after caffeine ingestion. Thus, in borderline hypertensive men, exaggerated responses to caffeine were: selective for diastolic BP, consistent with greater vasoconstriction, replicated in 2 protocols, and representative of nearly all borderline hypertensives. We suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression, as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment.",1,0,0,0

"Severe citrate toxicity complicating volunteer apheresis platelet donation. We report a case of severe citrate toxicity during volunteer donor apheresis platelet collection. The donor was a 40-year-old female, first-time apheresis platelet donor. Past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and depression. Reported medications included bumetanide, pravastatin, and paroxetine. Thirty minutes from the start of the procedure, the donor noted tingling around the mouth, hands, and feet. She then very rapidly developed acute onset of severe facial and extremity tetany. Empirical treatment with intravenous calcium gluconate was initiated, and muscle contractions slowly subsided over approximately 10 to 15 minutes. The events are consistent with a severe reaction to calcium chelation by sodium citrate anticoagulant resulting in symptomatic systemic hypocalcemia. Upon additional retrospective analysis, it was noted that bumetanide is a loop diuretic that may cause significant hypocalcemia. We conclude that careful screening for medications and underlying conditions predisposing to hypocalcemia is recommended to help prevent severe reactions due to citrate toxicity. Laboratory measurement of pre-procedure serum calcium levels in selected donors may identify cases requiring heightened vigilance. The case also illustrates the importance of maintaining preparedness for managing rare but serious reactions in volunteer apheresis blood donors.",1,0,0,0

"Epidemic of liver disease caused by hydrochlorofluorocarbons used as ozone-sparing substitutes of chlorofluorocarbons. BACKGROUND: Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are used increasingly in industry as substitutes for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Limited studies in animals indicate potential hepatotoxicity of some of these compounds. We investigated an epidemic of liver disease in nine industrial workers who had had repeated accidental exposure to a mixture of 1,1-dichloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (HCFC 123) and 1-chloro-1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethane (HCFC 124). All nine exposed workers were affected to various degrees. Both compounds are metabolised in the same way as 1-bromo-1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethane (halothane) to form reactive trifluoroacetyl halide intermediates, which have been implicated in the hepatotoxicity of halothane. We aimed to test whether HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver disease. METHODS: For one severely affected worker liver biopsy and immunohistochemical stainings for the presence of trifluoroacetyl protein adducts were done. The serum of six affected workers and five controls was tested for autoantibodies that react with human liver cytochrome-P450 2E1 (P450 2E1) and P58 protein disulphide isomerase isoform (P58). FINDINGS: The liver biopsy sample showed hepatocellular necrosis which was prominent in perivenular zone three and extended focally from portal tracts to portal tracts and centrilobular areas (bridging necrosis). Trifluoroacetyl-adducted proteins were detected in surviving hepatocytes. Autoantibodies against P450 2E1 or P58, previously associated with halothane hepatitis, were detected in the serum of five affected workers. INTERPRETATION: Repeated exposure of human beings to HCFCs 123 and 124 can result in serious liver injury in a large proportion of the exposed population. Although the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity of these agents is not known, the results suggest that trifluoroacetyl-altered liver proteins are involved. In view of the potentially widespread use of these compounds, there is an urgent need to develop safer alternatives.",0,1,0,0

"Molecular basis of human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency causing cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood. beta-Oxidation of long-chain fatty acids provides the major source of energy in the heart . Defects in enzymes of the beta-oxidation pathway cause sudden , unexplained death in childhood , acute hepatic encephalopathy or liver failure , skeletal myopathy , and cardiomyopathy .

We have isolated the human VLCAD cDNA and gene and determined the complete nucleotide sequences . Polymerase chain reaction amplification of VLCAD mRNA and genomic exons defined the molecular defects in two patients with VLCAD deficiency who presented with unexplained cardiac arrest and cardiomyopathy . In one , a homozygous mutation in the consensus dinucleotide of the donor splice site ( g + 1-- > a ) was associated with universal skipping of the prior exon ( exon 11 ) . The second patient was a compound heterozygote , with a missense mutation , C1837-- > T , changing the arginine at residue 613 to tryptophan on one allele and a single base deletion at the intron-exon 6 boundary as the second mutation . This initial delineation of human mutations in VLCAD suggests that VLCAD deficiency reduces myocardial fatty acid beta-oxidation and energy production and is associated with cardiomyopathy and sudden death in childhood .",1,1,0,0

"Detection of eight BRCA1 mutations in 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family with male breast cancer. Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests that mutations in BRCA1 may be responsible for approximately one half of early onset familial breast cancer and the majority of familial breast / ovarian cancer . The recent cloning of BRCA1 allows for the direct detection of mutations , but the feasibility of presymptomatic screening for cancer susceptibility is unknown . We analyzed genomic DNA from one affected individual from each of 24 families with at least three cases of ovarian or breast cancer , using SSCP assays . Variant SSCP bands were subcloned and sequenced . Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to verify sequence changes and to screen DNA from control individuals . Six frameshift and two missense mutations were detected in 10 different families . A frameshift mutation was detected in a male proband affected with both breast and prostate cancer . A 40-bp deletion was detected in a patient who developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year after prophylactic oophorectomy . Mutations were detected throughout the gene , and only one was detected in more than a single family . These results provide further evidence that inherited breast and ovarian cancer can occur as a consequence of a wide array of BRCA1 mutations .

"Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen. A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over-the-counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate, caffeine, and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum. Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS, attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen (52 micrograms/mL) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine. Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that: 1) pretreatment with acetaminophen (100 mg/kg) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine (300 to 450 mg/kg IP) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two; and 2) pretreatment with acetaminophen (75 mg/kg) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine (12.5 to 75 mg/kg IP). The frequency of sound-induced seizures after 12.5 or 25 mg/kg caffeine was reduced from 50 to 5% by acetaminophen. In the absence of caffeine, acetaminophen (up to 300 mg/kg) did not modify the seizures induced by maximal electroshock and did not alter the convulsant dose of pentylenetetrezol in mice (tests performed by the Anticonvulsant Screening Project of NINCDS). Acetaminophen (up to 150 micrograms/mL) did not retard the incorporation of radioactive adenosine into ATP in slices of rat cerebral cortex. Thus the mechanism by which acetaminophen antagonizes the actions of caffeine in the CNS remains unknown.",0,0,1,0

"Safety and side-effects of alprazolam. Controlled study in agoraphobia with panic disorder. BACKGROUND: The widespread use of benzodiazepines has led to increasing recognition of their unwanted effects. The efficacy of alprazolam and placebo in panic disorder with agoraphobia, and the side-effect and adverse effect profiles of both drug groups were measured. METHOD: In London and Toronto 154 patients who met DSM-III criteria for panic disorder with agoraphobia were randomised to alprazolam or placebo. Subjects in each drug group also received either exposure or relaxation. Treatment was from weeks 0 to 8 and was then tapered from weeks 8 to 16. RESULTS: Mean alprazolam dose was 5 mg daily. Compared with placebo subjects, alprazolam patients developed more adverse reactions (21% v. 0%) of depression, enuresis, disinhibition and aggression; and more side-effects, particularly sedation, irritability, impaired memory, weight loss and ataxia. Side-effects tended to diminish during treatment but remained significant at week 8. Despite this, the drop-out rate was low.

"Deficit of in vivo mitochondrial ATP production in patients with Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , the most common of the inherited ataxias , is an autosomal recessive degenerative disorder , characterized clinically by onset before the age of 25 of progressive gait and limb ataxia , absence of deep tendon reflexes , extensor plantar responses , and loss of position and vibration sense in the lower limbs . FRDA is caused by a GAA triplet expansion in the first intron of the FRDA gene on chromosome 9q13 in 97 % of patients . The FRDA gene encodes a widely expressed 210-aa protein , frataxin , which is located in mitochondria and is severely reduced in FRDA patients . Frataxin function is still unknown but the knockout of the yeast frataxin homologue gene ( YFH1 ) showed a severe defect of mitochondrial respiration and loss of mtDNA associated with elevated intramitochondrial iron . Here we report in vivo evidence of impaired mitochondrial respiration in skeletal muscle of FRDA patients . Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy we demonstrated a maximum rate of muscle mitochondrial ATP production ( V ( max ) ) below the normal range in all 12 FRDA patients and a strong negative correlation between mitochondrial V ( max ) and the number of GAA repeats in the smaller allele . Our results show that FRDA is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation and give a rationale for treatments aimed to improve mitochondrial function in this condition . .",0,0,1,0

"Fear-potentiated startle, but not light-enhanced startle, is enhanced by anxiogenic drugs. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The light-enhanced startle paradigm (LES) is suggested to model anxiety, because of the non-specific cue and the long-term effect. In contrast, the fear-potentiated startle (FPS) is suggested to model conditioned fear. However, the pharmacological profiles of these two paradigms are very similar. The present study investigated the effects of putative anxiogenic drugs on LES and FPS and aimed at determining the sensitivity of LES for anxiogenic drugs and to potentially showing a pharmacological differentiation between these two paradigms. METHODS: Male Wistar rats received each dose of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (0.25-1.0mg/kg), the 5-HT(2C) receptor agonist m-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP, 0.5-2.0mg/kg) or the GABA(A) inverse receptor agonist pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, 3-30mg/kg) and were subsequently tested in either LES or FPS. RESULTS: None of the drugs enhanced LES, whereas mCPP increased percentage FPS and yohimbine increased absolute FPS values. Furthermore, yohimbine increased baseline startle amplitude in the LES, while mCPP suppressed baseline startle in both the LES and FPS and PTZ suppressed baseline startle in the FPS. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to findings in the FPS paradigm, none of the drugs were able to exacerbate the LES response. Thus, a clear pharmacological differentiation was found between LES and FPS.",0,0,1,0
"Combined androgen blockade-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. BACKGROUND: To determine the onset and extent of combined androgen blockade (CAB)-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients without bone involvement. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-two patients with biopsy-proven prostatic adenocarcinoma [26 with stage C (T3N0M0) and 16 with stage D1 (T3N1M0)] were included in this study. All patients received CAB [leuprolide acetate (LHRH-A) 3.75 mg, intramuscularly, every 28 days plus 250 mg flutamide, tid, per Os] and were evaluated for anemia by physical examination and laboratory tests at baseline and 4 subsequent intervals (1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB). Hb, PSA and Testosterone measurements were recorded. Patients with stage D2-3 disease, abnormal hemoglobin level or renal and liver function tests that were higher than the upper limits were excluded from the study. The duration of the study was six months. RESULTS: The mean hemoglobin (Hb) levels were significantly declined in all patients from baseline of 14.2 g/dl to 14.0 g/dl, 13.5 g/dl, 13.2 g/dl and 12.7 g/dl at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months post-CAB, respectively. Severe and clinically evident anemia of Hb < 11 g/dl with clinical symptoms was detected in 6 patients (14.3%). This CAB-induced anemia was normochromic and normocytic. At six months post-CAB, patients with severe anemia had a Hb mean value of 10.2 +/- 0.1 g/dl (X +/- SE), whereas the other patients had mild anemia with Hb mean value of 13.2 +/- 0.17 (X +/- SE). The development of severe anemia at 6 months post-CAB was predictable by the reduction of Hb baseline value of more than 2.5 g/dl after 3 months of CAB (p = 0.01). The development of severe CAB-induced anemia in prostate cancer patients did not correlate with T baseline values (T < 3 ng/ml versus T > or = 3 ng/ml), with age (< 76 yrs versus > or = 76 yrs), and clinical stage (stage C versus stage D1). Severe and clinically evident anemia was easily corrected by subcutaneous injections (3 times/week for 1 month) of recombinant erythropoietin (rHuEPO-beta). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that rHuEPO-beta correctable CAB-induced anemia occurs in 14.3% of prostate cancer patients after 6 months of therapy.",0,1,1,1

"Ifosfamide encephalopathy presenting with asterixis. CNS toxic effects of the antineoplastic agent ifosfamide (IFX) are frequent and include a variety of neurological symptoms that can limit drug use. We report a case of a 51-year-old man who developed severe, disabling negative myoclonus of the upper and lower extremities after the infusion of ifosfamide for plasmacytoma. He was awake, revealed no changes of mental status and at rest there were no further motor symptoms. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging and extensive laboratory studies failed to reveal structural lesions of the brain and metabolic abnormalities. An electroencephalogram showed continuous, generalized irregular slowing with admixed periodic triphasic waves indicating symptomatic encephalopathy. The administration of ifosfamide was discontinued and within 12 h the asterixis resolved completely. In the patient described, the presence of asterixis during infusion of ifosfamide, normal laboratory findings and imaging studies and the resolution of symptoms following the discontinuation of the drug suggest that negative myoclonus is associated with the use of IFX.",0,0,1,0

"Rhabdomyolysis in a hepatitis C virus infected patient treated with telaprevir and simvastatin. A 46-year old man with a chronic hepatitis C virus infection received triple therapy with ribavirin, pegylated interferon and telaprevir. The patient also received simvastatin. One month after starting the antiviral therapy, the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis. At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug-drug interaction was suspected. The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU/L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline. The patient's renal function remained unaffected. Fourteen days after hospitalization, creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU/L and the patient was discharged. Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale. The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance. Simvastatin plasma concentration increased 30 times in this patient and statin induced muscle toxicity is related to the concentration of the statin in blood. In conclusion, with this case we illustrate that telaprevir as well as statins are susceptible to clinical relevant drug-drug interactions.",0,1,0,0

"The type of somatic mutation at APC in familial adenomatous polyposis is determined by the site of the germline mutation: a new facet to Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis. APC is often cited as a prime example of a tumor suppressor gene . Truncating germline and somatic mutations ( or , infrequently , allelic loss ) occur in tumors in FAP ( familial adenomatous polyposis ) . Most sporadic colorectal cancers also have two APC mutations . Clues from attenuated polyposis , missense germline variants with mild disease and the somatic mutation cluster region ( codons 1 , 250-1 , 450 ) indicate , however , that APC mutations might not result in simple loss of protein function . We have found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations within a small region ( codons 1 , 194-1 , 392 at most ) mainly show allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas , in contrast to other FAP patients , whose second hits tend to occur by truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region . Our results indicate that different APC mutations provide cells with different selective advantages , with mutations close to codon 1 , 300 providing the greatest advantage . Allelic loss is selected strongly in cells with one mutation near codon 1 , 300 . A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids . APC is not , therefore , a classical tumor suppressor . Our findings also indicate a new mechanism for disease severity  if a broader spectrum of mutations is selected in tumors , the somatic mutation rate is effectively higher and more tumors grow . .",0,0,0,1
"A large population-based follow-up study of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, and cephalexin for uncommon serious drug toxicity. We conducted a population-based 45-day follow-up study of 232,390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ), 266,951 prescribed trimethoprim alone, and 196,397 prescribed cephalexin, to estimate the risk of serious liver, blood, skin, and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these drugs. The results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the United Kingdom, together with a review of clinical records. The risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed TMP-SMZ (5.2/100,000) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone (3.8/100,000). The risk for those prescribed cephalexin was somewhat lower (2.0/100,000). Only five patients experienced blood disorders, one of whom was exposed to TMP-SMZ; of seven with erythema multiforme and Stevens-Johnson syndrome, four were exposed to TMP-SMZ. The one case of toxic epidermal necrolysis occurred in a patient who took cephalexin. Finally, only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred, none likely to be caused by a study drug. We conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents, and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics.",0,1,0,0

"Combined analysis of hereditary prostate cancer linkage to 1q24-25: results from 772 hereditary prostate cancer families from the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics. A previous linkage study provided evidence for a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25 . Subsequent reports in additional collections of families have yielded conflicting results . In addition , evidence for locus heterogeneity has been provided by the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28 , 1q42-43 , and 1p36 . The present study describes a combined analysis for six markers in the 1q24-25 region in 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer and ascertained by the members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics ( ICPCG ) from North America , Australia , Finland , Norway , Sweden , and the United Kingdom . Overall , there was some evidence for linkage , with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity ( HLOD ) of 1 . 40 ( P = . 01 ) at D1S212 . The estimated proportion of families ( alpha ) linked to the locus was . 06 ( 1-LOD support interval . 01- . 12 ) . This evidence was not observed by a nonparametric approach , presumably because of the extensive heterogeneity . Further parametric analysis revealed a significant effect of the presence of male-to-male disease transmission within the families . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . In the subset of 491 such families , the peak HLOD was 2 . 56 ( P = . 0006 ) and alpha = . 11 ( 1-LOD support interval . 04- . 19 ) , compared with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families . Within the families with male-to-male disease transmission , alpha increased with the early mean age at diagnosis ( prostate cancer-susceptibility gene linked to 1q24-25 , albeit in a defined subset of prostate cancer families . Although HPC1 accounts for only a small proportion of all families affected by hereditary prostate cancer , it appears to play a more prominent role in the subset of families with several members affected at an early age and with male-to-male disease transmission .",0,0,0,1
"Age at diagnosis as an indicator of eligibility for BRCA1 DNA testing in familial breast cancer. We searched for criteria that could indicate breast cancer families with a high prior probability of being caused by the breast / ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 on chromosome 17 . To this end , we performed a linkage study with 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families , including 16 with at least one case of ovarian cancer . We used an intake cut-off of at least three first-degree relatives with breast and / or ovarian cancer at any age . Significant evidence for linkage was found only among the 13 breast cancer families with a mean age at diagnosis of less than 45 years . An unexpectedly low proportion of the breast-ovarian cancer families were estimated to be linked to BRCA1 , which could be due to a founder effect in the Dutch population . Given the expected logistical problems in clinical management now that BRCA1 has been identified , we propose an interim period in which only families with a strong positive family history for early onset breast and / or ovarian cancer will be offered BRCA1 mutation testing . .",0,0,1,1

"Association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephropathy. BACKGROUND: In recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide (NO) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidney. We have studied the role of NO and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin (ADR). METHODS: The alteration in the NO pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum/urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney (IPRK) system. Rats were stratified into control groups and ADR-induced nephropathy groups. These two groups were then divided into: group 1, animals receiving saline; and group 2, animals receiving aminoguanidine (AG) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible-NO synthase. On day 21, rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analysis. RESULTS: Histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ADR revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflammation. They also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups (P < 0.05). Urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ADR-nephropathy group (P < 0.05). In the IPRK phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ADR-nephropathy group. Apoptosis was not detected in controls. However, in the ADR-nephropathy group, numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial areas. Double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ED1, a marker for monocytes/macrophages. Treatment with AG prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control levels. CONCLUSION: We suggest that interactions between NO and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ADR-induced nephrosis.",0,1,0,0
"Effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and eserine in cats. The effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group-housed unanaesthetized cats upon vocalization (rage, hissing and snarling), fighting (attack with paws and claws, defense with paws and claws and biting), mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and eserine injected similarly was investigated. Calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the vocalization and fighting due to carbachol and eserine. On the other hand, mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and eserine were not significantly changed by calcium chloride. It is apparent that calcium chloride can ""dissociate"" vocalization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as mydriasis, tremor and clonic-tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and eserine. Calcium chloride inhibited the vocalization and fighting produced by carbachol and eserine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic cholinoceptive sites. These results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine-like action also in the central nervous system.",1,0,0,0

"Antitumor effect, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in the IgM solid immunocytoma-bearing LOU/M/WSL rat. Antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals with a tumor (diameter, 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days, followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks (dose range, 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). Tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg. Complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade III was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin levels. In the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Ascites and hydrothorax were observed simultaneously. The same experiments were performed with non-tumor-bearing rats, in which no major differences were observed. In conclusion, antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same LOU/M/WSL rat. Albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels, so ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.",1,1,0,1

"Late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant. OBJECTIVES: Posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor-related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents (primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant). The pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain unknown. CASE: We report the case of a 46-year-old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transplant. After an initially uneventful course after the transplant, the patient rapidly fell into deep coma. RESULTS: Cerebral MRI scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regions. Switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situation. The termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complication. CONCLUSIONS: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is rare. We recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction.",0,1,1,0

"Hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syndrome. Plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin-angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome (NS). In this work the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of angiotensinogen (Ao) were analyzed with the slot-blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues: kidney, heart, brain, and adrenal gland from control, nephrotic, and pair-fed (PF) rats. NS was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino-nucleoside (PAN). Although a great urinary excretion and half-normal plasma levels of Ao were observed on day 6 after PAN injection, when NS was clearly established, hepatic Ao mRNA levels did not change. Furthermore, the Ao mRNA levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6, nor did its hepatic levels at days 1, 3, 5, or 7 after PAN injection. These data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic Ao mRNA levels are unaltered during the development of the acute NS induced by PAN.",1,1,1,0
"Caffeine challenge test in panic disorder and depression with panic attacks. Our aim was to observe if patients with panic disorder (PD) and patients with major depression with panic attacks (MDP) (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria) respond in a similar way to the induction of panic attacks by an oral caffeine challenge test. We randomly selected 29 patients with PD, 27 with MDP, 25 with major depression without panic attacks (MD), and 28 healthy volunteers. The patients had no psychotropic drug for at least a 4-week period. In a randomized double-blind experiment performed in 2 occasions 7 days apart, 480 mg caffeine and a caffeine-free (placebo) solution were administered in a coffee form and anxiety scales were applied before and after each test. A total of 58.6% (n = 17) of patients with PD, 44.4% (n = 12) of patients with MDP, 12.0% (n = 3) of patients with MD, and 7.1% (n= 2) of control subjects had a panic attack after the 480-mg caffeine challenge test (chi(2)(3) = 16.22, P = .001). The patients with PD and MDP were more sensitive to caffeine than were patients with MD and healthy volunteers. No panic attack was observed after the caffeine-free solution intake. The patients with MD had a lower heart rate response to the test than all the other groups (2-way analysis of variance, group by time interaction with Greenhouse-Geisser correction: F(3,762) = 2.85, P = .026).

We reexamined a group of VHL patients shown previously by single-strand conformation and sequencing analysis not to harbor point mutations in the VHL locus . We found constitutional deletions in 29 of 30 VHL patients in this group using cosmid and P1 probes that cover the VHL locus . We then tested six phenotypically normal offspring from four of these VHL families  two were found to carry the deletion and the other four were deletion-free . In addition , germline mosaicism of the VHL gene was identified in one family . In sum , FISH was found to be a simple and reliable method to detect VHL germline deletions and practically useful in cases where other methods of screening have failed to detect a VHL gene abnormality",0,1,0,1
"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and methylphenidate. A 1-year-old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate. She had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum (multicystic encephalomalacia) due to severe perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syndrome. A dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syndrome. However, methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine, and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem (mainly the midbrain) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syndrome. A relative gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam, a gamma-aminobutyric acid-mimetic agent, was strikingly effective.

"Gene therapy for phenylketonuria. Classical phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . Limitations of the current dietary treatment for PKU have led to the development of potential treatments based on somatic gene transfer . Three different vector systems have been examined . Vectors derived from a recombinant retrovirus or a DNA / protein complex can efficiently transduce the PAH cDNA into PAH-deficient hepatocytes in vitro , but the application of these vector systems is presently limited by their low transduction efficiency in vivo . In contrast , a vector derived from a recombinant adenovirus can restore 10 % -80 % of normal hepatic PAH activity into PAH-deficient mice , which completely normalizes serum phenylalanine levels . This treatment is transient and cannot be effectively re-administered due to the presence of neutralizing antibodies directed against the recombinant adenoviral vector .

"A dramatic drop in blood pressure following prehospital GTN administration. A male in his sixties with no history of cardiac chest pain awoke with chest pain following an afternoon sleep. The patient did not self medicate. The patient's observations were within normal limits, he was administered oxygen via a face mask and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). Several minutes after the GTN the patient experienced a sudden drop in blood pressure and heart rate, this was rectified by atropine sulphate and a fluid challenge. There was no further deterioration in the patient's condition during transport to hospital. There are very few documented case like this in the prehospital scientific literature. The cause appears to be the Bezold-Jarish reflex, stimulation of the ventricular walls which in turn decreases sympathetic outflow from the vasomotor centre.

"The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice. PURPOSE: Despite its well-known cardiotoxicity, the anthracyclin doxorubicin (DOX) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX. Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) showed cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Because of the relatively short final half-life of monoHER (about 30 min), it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effect. METHODS: Six groups of 6 BALB/c mice were treated with saline, DOX alone or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) with an interval of 10, 30, 60 or 120 min. After a 6-week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks, the mice were sacrificed. Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy, after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham (in Cancer Treat Rep 62(6):865-872, 1978). Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group (P<0.001). RESULTS: The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold (95% CI 4.4-21.0) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group. The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) of abnormal cardiomyocytes. This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX.",1,0,0,1

"Dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal failure. In this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected, and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood vessels. The new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered, but also dynamics of this response, was used in this paper. Our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals. The beneficial effects of vitamin C administration to gentamicin-treated animals are also confirmed through: lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of potassium. The pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin-treated animals (8.07 +/- 1.7 s vs. 5.64 +/- 0.18 s). Vitamin C administration induced slowdown of pressure change back to the control values. The pressure dynamic properties, quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic, confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin-treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin C administration.",0,1,0,0
"The relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure-prone and withdrawal seizure-resistant selected mouse lines. BACKGROUND: The septo-hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epileptogenesis, and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents, but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal severity. Thus, the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal severity. METHODS: Cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol-na  ve Withdrawal Seizure-Prone (WSP) and-Resistant (WSR) mice. Animals were administered nicotine, carbachol, or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion, and the latencies to onset of tremor and clonus were recorded and converted to threshold dose. We also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium-stimulated acetylcholine (ACh) release in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice, separated by 75 min. Hippocampal ACh also was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions. RESULTS: Sensitivity to several convulsion endpoints induced by nicotine, carbachol, and neostigmine were significantly greater in WSR versus WSP mice. In microdialysis experiments, the lines did not differ in basal release of ACh, and 50 mM KCl increased ACh output in both lines of mice. However, the increase in release of ACh produced by the first application of KCl was 2-fold higher in WSP versus WSR mice. When hippocampal ACh was measured during testing for handling-induced convulsions, extracellular ACh was significantly elevated (192%) in WSP mice, but was nonsignificantly elevated (59%) in WSR mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdrawal. Specifically, WSP mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convulsants compared with WSR because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons.",0,0,1,0
"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation. BACKGROUND: Unfractionated heparin sodium (UFH) or low-molecular weight heparin (LMWH) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transplantation. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an adverse immune-mediated reaction to heparin, resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50%. The frequencies of HIT after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4/heparin-reactive antibody (HIT antibody) positivity in liver transplantation patients, however, are unknown. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transplantation. We started LMWH (25 IU/kg/h) on postoperative day (POD) 1, switching to UFH (5000 U/d) on POD 2 or 3. The dose of UFH was changed according to the activated clotting time level. HIT antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on POD 7 and 14. Platelet count was measured daily for 3 weeks. RESULTS: The average platelet counts preoperatively, and on POD 7, 14, and 21 were 65, 88, 149, and 169 x 10(9)/L, respectively. Two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on POD 11 and 19, respectively, although they were HIT antibody-negative and their platelet counts were stable. In 2 other patients, the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10(9)/L on POD 4 to 65 x 10(9)/L on POD 6 and from 76 x 10(9)/L on POD 7 to 33 x 10(9)/L on POD 9, respectively. The heparin-induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patients. The percentage of HIT antibody-positive patients was 0.5% preoperatively, 5.6% on POD 7, and 5.6% on POD 14. None of the subjects/patients developed UFH-related HIT. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, the occurrence of HIT after liver transplantation was uncommon.",1,1,0,0

"Multiple origins for phenylketonuria in Europe. Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , a disorder of amino acid metabolism prevalent among Caucasians and other ethnic groups , is caused primarily by a deficiency of the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . PKU is a highly heterogeneous disorder , with more than 60 molecular lesions identified in the PAH gene . The haplotype associations , relative frequencies , and distributions of five prevalent PAH mutations ( R158Q , R261Q , IVS10nt546 , R408W , and IVS12n1 ) were established in a comprehensive European sample population and subsequently were examined to determine the potential roles of several genetic mechanisms in explaining the present distribution of the major PKU alleles . Each of these five mutations was strongly associated with only one of the more than 70 chromosomal haplotypes defined by eight RFLPs in or near the PAH gene . These findings suggest that each of these mutations arose through a single founding event that occurred within time periods ranging from several hundred to several thousand years ago . From the significant differences observed in the relative frequencies and distributions of these five alleles throughout Europe , four of these putative founding events could be localized to specific ethnic subgroups . Together , these data suggest that there were multiple , geographically and ethnically distinct origins for PKU within the European population . .",0,1,1,0
"Adriamycin-induced autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays a pathogenic role in a rat model of heart failure. BACKGROUND: The mechanisms underlying heart failure induced by adriamycin are very complicated and still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether autophagy was involved in the progression of heart failure induced by adriamycin, so that we can develop a novel treatment strategy for heart failure. METHODS: 3-methyladenine (3MA), a specific inhibitor on autophagy was used in a heart failure model of rats induced by adriamycin. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and randomly divided into controls, an adriamycin-treated group, and a 3MA plus adriamycin-treated group. We then examined the morphology, expression of beclin 1 gene, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and Na+-K+ ATPase activity in vivo. We also assessed cell viability, mitochondrial membrane potential changes and counted autophagic vacuoles in cultured cardiomyocytes. In addition, we analyzed the expression of autophagy associated gene, beclin 1 using RT-PCR and Western blotting in an animal model. RESULTS: 3MA significantly improved cardiac function and reduced mitochondrial injury. Furthermore, adriamycin induced the formation of autophagic vacuoles, and 3MA strongly downregulated the expression of beclin 1 in adriamycin-induced failing heart and inhibited the formation of autophagic vacuoles. CONCLUSION: Autophagic cardiomyocyte death plays an important role in the pathogenesis of heart failure in rats induced by adriamycin. Mitochondrial injury may be involved in the progression of heart failure caused by adriamycin via the autophagy pathway.",1,0,1,0

"Apomorphine: an underutilized therapy for Parkinson's disease. Apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease. While powerful antiparkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 1951, the potential of treating fluctuating Parkinson's disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic study. A number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce antiparkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably revert off-periods even in patients with complex on-off motor swings. Continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off-time by more than 50% in this group of patients, which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add-on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or COMT inhibitors. Extended follow-up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long-term persistence of apomorphine efficacy. In addition, there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa-induced dyskinesias. The main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems, whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser role. Given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating Parkinson's disease, this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use.",0,0,1,0

"Mild and severe muscular dystrophy associated with deletions in Xp21 of the human X chromosome. We have analysed over 300 patients suffering from Duchenne or Becker muscular dystrophy ( DMD or BMD ) . Deletions have been characterised which encompass either the pERT87 ( DXS164 ) locus only , the XJ1 . 1 ( DXS206 ) and HIP25 loci only , or all three loci . These loci have been shown to lie within the DMD region covering several hundred kilobases ( kb ) of DNA . One mildly affected BMD patient possesses a deletion of at least 110 kb including exons of the DMD gene . Other patients with similar exon deletions , or smaller deletions , show the more severe phenotype typical of DMD . We conclude from these studies that the severity of the clinical phenotype cannot be explained on the basis of the size of the deletion .

"Mutations of the ATM gene detected in Japanese ataxia-telangiectasia patients: possible preponderance of the two founder mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5. The ATM ( A-T , mutated ) gene on human chromosome 11q22 . 3 has recently been identified as the gene responsible for the human recessive disease ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) . In order to define the types of disease-causing ATM mutations in Japanese A-T patients as well as to look for possible mutational hotspots , reverse-transcribed RNA derived from ten patients belonging to eight unrelated Japanese A-T families was analyzed for mutations by the restriction endonuclease fingerprinting method . As has been reported by others , mutations that lead to exon skipping or premature protein truncation were also predominant in our mutants . Six different mutations were identified on 12 of the 16 alleles examined . Four were deletions involving a loss of a single exon  exon 7 , exon 16 , exon 33 or exon 35 . The others were minute deletions , 4649delA in exon 33 and 7883del5 in exon 55 . The mutations 4612del165 and 7883del5 were found in more than two unrelated families ; 44 % ( 7 of 16 ) of the mutant alleles had one of the two mutations . The 4612del165 mutations in three different families were all ascribed to the same T-- > A substitution at the splice donor site in intron 33 . Microsatellite genotyping around the ATM locus also indicated that a common haplotype was shared by the mutant alleles in both mutations . This suggests that these two founder mutations may be predominant among Japanese ATM mutant alleles .",0,0,1,0

"Molecular basis of essential fructosuria: molecular cloning and mutational analysis of human ketohexokinase (fructokinase). Essential fructosuria is one of the oldest known inborn errors of metabolism . It is a benign condition which is believed to result from deficiency of hepatic fructokinase ( ketohexokinase , KHK , E . C . 2 . 7 . 1 . 3 ) . This enzyme catalyses the first step of metabolism of dietary fructose , conversion of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate . Despite the early recognition of this disorder , the primary structure of human KHK and the molecular basis of essential fructosuria have not been previously defined . In this report , the isolation and sequencing of full-length cDNA clones encoding human ketohexokinase are described . Alternative mRNA species and alternative KHK isozymes are produced by alternative polyadenylation and splicing of the KHK gene . The KHK proteins show a high level of sequence conservation relative to rat KHK . Direct evidence that mutation of the KHK structural gene is the cause of essential fructosuria was also obtained . In a well-characterized family , in which three of eight siblings have fructosuria , all affected individuals are compound heterozygotes for two mutations Gly40Arg and Ala43Thr . Both mutations result from G-- > A transitions , and each alters the same conserved region of the KHK protein . Neither mutation was seen in a sample of 52 unrelated control individuals .

"Case report: acute unintentional carbachol intoxication. INTRODUCTION: Intoxications with carbachol, a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are rare. We report an interesting case investigating a (near) fatal poisoning. METHODS: The son of an 84-year-old male discovered a newspaper report stating clinical success with plant extracts in Alzheimer's disease. The mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound 'carbamylcholin'; that is, carbachol. He bought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy, and the father was administered 400 to 500 mg. Carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by HPLC-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Minutes after oral administration, the patient developed nausea, sweating and hypotension, and finally collapsed. Bradycardia, cholinergic symptoms and asystole occurred. Initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline (epinephrine), atropine and furosemide was successful. On hospital admission, blood pressure of the intubated, bradyarrhythmic patient was 100/65 mmHg. Further signs were hyperhidrosis, hypersalivation, bronchorrhoea, and severe miosis; the electrocardiographic finding was atrio-ventricular dissociation. High doses of atropine (up to 50 mg per 24 hours), adrenaline and dopamine were necessary. The patient was extubated 1 week later. However, increased dyspnoea and bronchospasm necessitated reintubation. Respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by Proteus mirabilis infection and severe bronchoconstriction. One week later, the patient was again extubated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral ward. On the next day he died, probably as a result of heart failure. Serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg/l carbachol, respectively. The corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 554 mg/l. CONCLUSION: This case started with a media report in a popular newspaper, initiated by published, peer-reviewed research on herbals, and involved human failure in a case history, medical examination and clinical treatment. For the first time, an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been developed. The analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 260. Especially in old patients, intensivists should consider intoxications (with cholinergics) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure.",1,1,1,0

"Survey of complications of indocyanine green angiography in Japan. PURPOSE: We evaluated the safety of indocyanine green for use in fundus angiography. METHODS: We sent a questionnaire concerning complications of indocyanine green to 32 institutions in Japan, which were selected on the basis of the client list from the Topcon Company, which manufactures the indocyanine green fundus camera. RESULTS: Ophthalmologists at 15 institutions responded, reporting a total of 3,774 indocyanine green angiograms performed on 2,820 patients between June 1984 and September 1992. Before angiography, intradermal or intravenous indocyanine green testing, or both was performed at 13 of 15 institutions. For three patients, the decision was made not to proceed with angiography after positive preangiographic testing. The dosage of indocyanine green used for angiography varied from 25 to 75 mg, depending upon the institution. There were 13 cases of adverse reactions (0.34%), ten of which were mild reactions such as nausea, exanthema, urtication, itchiness, and urgency to defecate, and did not require treatment. Also recorded were one case of pain of the vein, which required treatment, and two cases of hypotension. The two hypotensive patients required treatment for shock. CONCLUSIONS: A comparison of frequency of adverse reactions to indocyanine green with the previously reported frequency of such reactions to fluorescein sodium indicated that indocyanine green is a safe as fluorescein for use in angiography.",0,0,1,0

"Down-regulation of transmembrane carbonic anhydrases in renal cell carcinoma cell lines by wild-type von Hippel-Lindau transgenes. To discover genes involved in von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) -mediated carcinogenesis , we used renal cell carcinoma cell lines stably transfected with wild-type VHL-expressing transgenes . Large-scale RNA differential display technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially expressed genes , including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene , termed CA12 . The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass transmembrane CA possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module . Reintroduced wild-type VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines . Similar results were obtained with CA9 , encoding another transmembrane CA with an intact catalytic domain . Although both domains of the VHL protein contribute to regulation of CA12 expression , the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression . We mapped CA12 and CA9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21 . 2 respectively , regions prone to amplification in some human cancers . Additional experiments are needed to define the role of CA IX and CA XII enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth .",0,1,0,1
"Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) subunit mRNA and protein expression in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside-induced nephrotic syndrome. In experimental nephrotic syndrome, urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease. The molecular mechanism(s) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucidated. The rate-limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome. The time courses of urinary sodium excretion, plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle. The relative amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNAs were determined in kidneys from these rats by real-time quantitative TaqMan PCR, and the amounts of proteins by Western blot. The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously. Sodium retention occurred on days 2, 3 and 6 after PAN injection. A significant up-regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. Conversely, down-regulation of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations, and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values. The amounts of alphaENaC, betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN-induced sodium retention. In conclusion, ENaC mRNA expression, especially alphaENaC, is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN-induced nephrotic syndrome in rats, but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3.",0,1,0,0

"An open-label phase II study of low-dose thalidomide in androgen-independent prostate cancer. The antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and haematological malignancies. Thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including bFGF, VEGF and IL-6. We undertook an open-label study using thalidomide 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with androgen-independent prostate cancer. The mean time of study was 109 days (median 107, range 4-184 days). Patients underwent regular measurement of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), urea and electrolytes, serum bFGF and VEGF. Three men (15%) showed a decline in serum PSA of at least 50%, sustained throughout treatment. Of 16 men treated for at least 2 months, six (37.5%) showed a fall in absolute PSA by a median of 48%. Increasing levels of serum bFGF and VEGF were associated with progressive disease; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in PSA also showed a decline in bFGF and VEGF levels, and three of four men with a rising PSA showed an increase in both growth factors. Adverse effects included constipation, morning drowsiness, dizziness and rash, and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men. Evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was found in nine of 13 men before treatment. In the seven men who completed six months on thalidomide, subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found in four before treatment, but in all seven at repeat testing. The findings indicate that thalidomide may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy, provided close follow-up is maintained for development of peripheral neuropathy.",0,0,1,1

"BRCA1 R841W: a strong candidate for a common mutation with moderate phenotype. BRCA1 mutations cause increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer , frequently of early onset . Many different mutations occur in BRCA1 , including several examples of recurrent mutations , each of which accounts for a significant number of families with heritable cancer predisposition . These common mutations have an etiological role in many breast and ovarian cancer cases and provide the opportunity to examine genotype-phenotype correlations and genotype-environment interactions in individuals with the identical BRCA1 lesion . We report a novel missense change in BRCA1 , 2640 C-- > T ( R841W ) , found in 3 cases from a subject group of 305 breast and 79 ovarian cancer cases from Orange County , CA . These are consecutive , population-based cases not selected for age or family history . In all three cases , there is a strong family history of breast , ovarian , or other cancers possibly related to a BRCA1 defect and family members showed a high concordance of cancer incidence with the presence of R841W . The age of cancer onset was not always distinct from typical sporadic cases . Testing of a sample of 413 unrelated individuals to examine the hypothesis that R841W might be a rare polymorphism detected one additional instance in a woman with breast cancer diagnosed at age 77 years , and cancer in one parent .

"An unusual toxic reaction to axillary block by mepivacaine with adrenaline. An increase in blood pressure, accompanied by atrial fibrillation, agitation, incomprehensible shouts and loss of consciousness, was observed in an elderly, ASA classification group II, cardiovascularly medicated male, 12 min after performance of axillary block with mepivacaine 850 mg containing adrenaline 0.225 mg, for correction of Dupuytren's contracture. After intravenous administration of labetalol, metoprolol and midazolam the patient's condition improved, and 15 min later he woke up. The block was successful and surgery was conducted as scheduled despite persisting atrial fibrillation. Postoperatively, the patient refused DC cardioversion and was treated medically. Both the temporal relationship of events and the response to treatment suggest that a rapid systemic absorption of mepivacaine with adrenaline and/or interaction of these drugs with the patient's cardiovascular medications were responsible for the perioperative complications.",1,1,0,0

"Genetic instability in human ovarian cancer cell lines. We have analyzed the stability of microsatellites in cell lines derived from human ovarian cancers and found that 5 out of 10 of the ovarian tumor cell lines are genetically unstable at the majority of the loci analyzed . In clones and subclones derived serially from one of these cell lines ( 2774 ; serous cystadenocarcinoma ) , a very high proportion of microsatellites distributed in many different regions of the genome change their size in a mercurial fashion . We conclude that genomic instability in ovarian tumors is a dynamic and ongoing process whose high frequency may have been previously underestimated by PCR-based allelotyping of bulk tumor tissue . We have identified the source of the genetic instability in one ovarian tumor as a point mutation ( R524P ) in the human mismatch-repair gene MSH2 ( Salmonella MutS homologue ) , which has recently been shown to be involved in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer . Patient 2774 was a 38-year-old heterozygote , and her normal tissue carried both mutant and wild-type alleles of the human MSH2 gene . However the wild-type allele was lost at some point early during tumorigenesis so that DNA isolated either from the patients ovarian tumor or from the 2774 cell line carries only the mutant allele of the human MSH2 gene . The genetic instability observed in the tumor and cell line DNA , together with the germ-line mutation in a mismatch-repair gene , suggest that the MSH2 gene is involved in the onset and / or progression in a subset of ovarian cancer . .",0,0,1,1
"Optimization of levodopa therapy. While there is no single correct starting dose for levodopa therapy, many individuals can be started on either the 25/100 or controlled-release formula, following the general rule not to attempt to titrate carbidopa-levodopa to the point of ""normality,"" which can lead to toxicity. The physician should also determine the proper use of any adjunctive medications; such combined therapy has become the standard approach to treatment. Following the initial period of therapy, emerging difficulties require a reassessment of therapeutic approaches, such as dosage adjustment or introduction of a dopamine agonist. Other possible adverse effects--such as gastrointestinal disorders, orthostatic hypotension, levodopa-induced psychosis, sleep disturbances or parasomnias, or drug interactions--also require carefully monitored individual treatment.

"Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency. The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",0,0,1,0

"A metoprolol-terbinafine combination induced bradycardia. To report a sinus bradycardia induced by metoprolol and terbinafine drug-drug interaction and its management. A 63 year-old Caucasian man on metoprolol 200 mg/day for stable coronary artery disease was prescribed a 90-day course of oral terbinafine 250 mg/day for onychomycosis. On the 49th day of terbinafine therapy, he was brought to the emergency room for a decrease of his global health status, confusion and falls. The electrocardiogram revealed a 37 beats/min sinus bradycardia. A score of 7 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the patient's sinus bradycardia and the drug interaction between metoprolol and terbinafine. The heart rate ameliorated first with a decrease in the dose of metoprolol. It was subsequently changed to bisoprolol and the heart rate remained normal. By inhibiting the cytochrome P450 2D6, terbinafine had decreased metoprolol's clearance, leading in metoprolol accumulation which has resulted in clinically significant sinus bradycardia.",1,0,0,0

"Effects of a new calcium antagonist, CD-832, on isoproterenol-induced myocardial ischemia in dogs with partial coronary stenosis. Effects of CD-832 on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial ischemia were studied in dogs with partial coronary stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery and findings were compared with those for nifedipine or diltiazem. In the presence of coronary artery stenosis, 3-min periods of intracoronary ISO infusion (10 ng/kg/min) increased heart rate and maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise, which resulted in a decrease in percentage segmental shortening and ST-segment elevation of the epicardial electrocardiogram. After the control ISO infusion with stenosis was performed, equihypotensive doses of CD-832 (3 and 10 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7), nifedipine (1 and 3 micrograms/kg/min, n = 9) or diltiazem (10 and 30 micrograms/kg/min, n = 7) were infused 5 min before and during the second and third ISO infusion. Both CD-832 and diltiazem, but not nifedipine, significantly reduced the increase in heart rate induced by ISO infusion. In contrast to nifedipine, CD-832 (10 micrograms/kg/min) prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 32 +/- 12% to 115 +/- 26% of the control value (P < .01) and ST-segment elevation from 5.6 +/- 1.0 mV to 1.6 +/- 1.3 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. Diltiazem (30 micrograms/kg/min) also prevented the decrease in percentage segmental shortening from 34 +/- 14% to 63 +/- 18% of the control value (P < .05) and ST-segment elevation from 4.7 +/- 0.7 mV to 2.1 +/- 0.7 mV (P < .01) at 3 min after ISO infusion with stenosis. These data show that CD-832 improves myocardial ischemia during ISO infusion with stenosis and suggest that the negative chronotropic property of CD-832 plays a major role in the beneficial effects of CD-832.",1,0,1,0

"The effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intoxication.

Haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine-induced seizures, but did lower the mortality rate at most doses tested. Haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine-induced seizures at the two highest doses, but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dose. These data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high-dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seizures.

"Mitral annuloplasty as a ventricular restoration method for the failing left ventricle: a pilot study. BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Undersized mitral annuloplasty (MAP) is effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and functional mitral regurgitation (MR) since, as well as addressing the MR, the MAP may also reshape the dilated left ventricular (LV) base. However, the direct benefits of this possible reshaping on LV function in the absence of underlying MR remain incompletely understood. The study aim was to identify these benefits in a canine model of acute heart failure. METHODS: Six dogs underwent MAP with a prosthetic band on the posterior mitral annulus, using four mattress sutures. The sutures were passed individually through four tourniquets and exteriorized untied via the left atriotomy. Sonomicrometry crystals were implanted around the mitral annulus and left ventricle to measure geometry and regional function. Acute heart failure was induced by propranolol and volume loading after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass; an absence of MR was confirmed by echocardiography. MAP was accomplished by cinching the tourniquets. Data were acquired at baseline, after induction of acute heart failure, and after MAP. RESULTS: MAP decreased mitral annular dimensions in both commissure-commissure and septal-lateral directions. Concomitantly, the diastolic diameter of the LV base and LV sphericity decreased (i.e., improved) from 37.4 +/- 9.3 to 35.9 +/- 10 mm (p = 0.063), and from 67.9 +/- 18.6% to 65.3 +/- 18.9% (p = 0.016), respectively. Decreases were evident in both LV end-diastolic pressure (from 17 +/- 7 to 15 +/- 6 mmHg, p = 0.0480 and Tau (from 48 +/- 8 to 45 +/- 8 ms, p <0.01), while fractional shortening at the LV base increased from 7.7 +/- 4.5% to 9.4 +/- 4.5% (p = 0.045). After MAP, increases were identified in both cardiac output (from 1.54 +/- 0.57 to 1.65 +/- 0.57 1/min) and Emax (from 1.86 +/- 0.9 to 2.41 +/- 1.31 mmHg/ml). CONCLUSION: The data acquired suggest that isolated MAP may have certain benefits on LV dimension/function in acute heart failure, even in the absence of MR.

"Cardiovascular risk with cyclooxygenase inhibitors: general problem with substance specific differences?. Randomised clinical trials and observational studies have shown an increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension and heart failure during treatment with cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Adverse cardiovascular effects occurred mainly, but not exclusively, in patients with concomitant risk factors. Cyclooxygenase inhibitors cause complex changes in renal, vascular and cardiac prostanoid profiles thereby increasing vascular resistance and fluid retention. The incidence of cardiovascular adverse events tends to increase with the daily dose and total exposure time. A comparison of individual selective and unselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors suggests substance-specific differences, which may depend on differences in pharmacokinetic parameters or inhibitory potency and may be contributed by prostaglandin-independent effects. Diagnostic markers such as N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) or high-sensitive C-reactive protein might help in the early identification of patients at risk, thus avoiding the occurrence of serious cardiovascular toxicity.",1,1,1,0
"Contrast medium nephrotoxicity after renal artery and coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND: Renal dysfunction induced by iodinated contrast medium (CM) administration can minimize the benefit of the interventional procedure in patients undergoing renal angioplasty (PTRA). PURPOSE: To compare the susceptibility to nephrotoxic effect of CM in patients undergoing PTRA with that of patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients successfully treated with PTRA (PTRA group, mean age 70+/-12 years, 23 female, basal creatinine 1.46+/-0.79, range 0.7-4.9 mg/dl) were compared with 33 patients undergoing successful PCI (PCI group), matched for basal creatinine (1.44+/-0.6, range 0.7-3.4 mg/dl), gender, and age. In both groups postprocedural (48 h) serum creatinine was measured. RESULTS: Postprocedural creatinine level decreased nonsignificantly in the PTRA group (1.46+/-0.8 vs. 1.34+/-0.5 mg/dl, P=NS) and increased significantly in the PCI group (1.44+/-0.6 vs. 1.57+/-0.7 mg/dl, P<0.02). Changes in serum creatinine after intervention (after-before) were significantly different between the PTRA and PCI groups (-0.12+/-0.5 vs. 0.13+/-0.3, P=0.014). This difference was not related to either a different clinical risk profile or to the volume of CM administered. CONCLUSION: In this preliminary study patients submitted to PTRA showed a lower susceptibility to renal damage induced by CM administration than PCI patients. The effectiveness of PTRA on renal function seems to be barely influenced by CM toxicity.",1,1,1,0
"Cis and trans effects of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) mutation in a cell culture model. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) has been identified as a CTG expansion in the 3-untranslated region ( 3-UTR ) of the DM protein kinase gene ( DMPK ) , but the mechanism ( s ) of pathogenesis remain unknown . Studies using DM patient materials have often produced confusing results . Therefore , to study the effects of the DM mutation in a controlled environment , we have established a cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts . By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing a reporter gene fused to a human DMPK 3-UTR , we identified both cis and trans effects that are mediated by the DM mutation . Our data show that a mutant DMPK 3-UTR , with as few as 57 CTGs , had a negative cis effect on protein expression and resulted in the aggregation of reporter transcripts into discrete nuclear foci . We determined by deletion analysis that an expanded ( CTG ) ( n ) tract alone was sufficient to mediate these cis effects . Furthermore , in contrast to the normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA , a mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA with ( CUG ) ( 200 ) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts . Genetic analysis and the Cre- loxP system were used to clearly demonstrate that the myoblast fusion defect could be rescued by eliminating the expression of the mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript . Characterization of spontaneous deletion events mapped the inhibitory effect to the ( CTG ) ( n ) expansion and / or the 3 end of the DMPK 3-UTR . These results provide evidence that the DM mutation acts in cis to reduce protein production ( consistent with DMPK haploinsufficiency ) and in trans as a riboregulator to inhibit myogenesis . .",0,0,1,0

"Estradiol reduces seizure-induced hippocampal injury in ovariectomized female but not in male rats. Estrogens protect ovariectomized rats from hippocampal injury induced by kainic acid-induced status epilepticus (SE). We compared the effects of 17beta-estradiol in adult male and ovariectomized female rats subjected to lithium-pilocarpine-induced SE. Rats received subcutaneous injections of 17beta-estradiol (2 microg/rat) or oil once daily for four consecutive days. SE was induced 20 h following the second injection and terminated 3 h later. The extent of silver-stained CA3 and CA1 hippocampal neurons was evaluated 2 days after SE. 17beta-Estradiol did not alter the onset of first clonus in ovariectomized rats but accelerated it in males. 17beta-Estradiol reduced the argyrophilic neurons in the CA1 and CA3-C sectors of ovariectomized rats.

In normal rats, the media of small arteries (0.4--0.2 mm in diameter) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles, identified ultrastructurally as herniations of one smooth muscle cell into another. The hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been tested. In the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch, vasoconstriction induced by L-norepinephrine produced many cell-to-cell hernias within 15 minutes. At 1 day their number was reduced to about 1/10 of the original number. By 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal. Triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the media. These findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function. The experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spasm. Endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper.",1,0,0,0

"Age of onset in Huntington disease : sex specific influence of apolipoprotein E genotype and normal CAG repeat length . Age of onset ( AO ) of Huntington disease ( HD) is known to be correlated with the length of an expanded CAG repeat in the HD gene . Apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) genotype , in turn , is known to influence AO in Alzheimer disease , rendering the APOE gene a likely candidate to affect AO in other neurological diseases too . We therefore determined APOE genotype and normal CAG repeat length in the HD gene for 138 HD patients who were previously analysed with respect to CAG repeat length . Genotyping for APOE was performed blind to clinical information . In addition to highlighting the effect of the normal repeat length upon AO in maternally inherited HD and in male patients , we show that the APOE epsilon2epsilon3 genotype is associated with significantly earlier AO in males than in females . Such a sex difference in AO was not apparent for any of the other APOE genotypes . Our findings suggest that subtle differences in the course of the neurodegeneration  in HD  may allow interacting genes to exert gender specific effects upon AO.",0,0,1,0
"Warfarin-induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D. The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma-carboxylation of matrix Gla protein, a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall. The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin-treated rats. Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day-old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day-old rats. In contrast, no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month-old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment. To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin-induced artery calcification in animals of the same age, 20-day-old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g/d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth. Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum-fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited group. Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study, there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification, with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young, ad libitum-fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin-induced artery calcification, ie, the 10-month-old rats and the restricted-diet, growth-inhibited young rats. This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin-induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels. The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification. High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days. High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media, but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week. In the current study, we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D-treated rats at 3 and 4 days. There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium, which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium. Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D, the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor. High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin, and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma-carboxylated. These observations indicate that although the gamma-carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor, they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites.",1,0,0,0

"Missense mutation in the alternative splice region of the PAX6 gene in eye anomalies. The PAX6 gene is involved in ocular morphogenesis , and PAX6 mutations have been detected in various types of ocular anomalies , including aniridia , Peters anomaly , corneal dystrophy , congenital cataract , and foveal hypoplasia . The gene encodes a transcriptional regulator that recognizes target genes through its paired-type DNA-binding domain . The paired domain is composed of two distinct DNA-binding subdomains , the N-terminal subdomain ( NTS ) and the C-terminal subdomain ( CTS ) , which bind respective consensus DNA sequences . The human PAX6 gene produces two alternative splice isoforms that have the distinct structure of the paired domain . The insertion , into the NTS , of 14 additional amino acids encoded by exon 5a abolishes the DNA-binding activity of the NTS and unmasks the DNA-binding ability of the CTS . Thus , exon 5a appears to function as a molecular switch that specifies target genes . We ascertained a novel missense mutation in four pedigrees with Peters anomaly , congenital cataract , Axenfeldt anomaly , and / or foveal hypoplasia , which , to our knowledge , is the first mutation identified in the splice-variant region . A T-- > A transition at the 20th nucleotide position of exon 5a results in a Val-- > Asp ( GTC-- > GAC ) substitution at the 7th codon of the alternative splice region . Functional analyses demonstrated that the V54D mutation slightly increased NTS binding and decreased CTS transactivation activity to almost half . .",0,0,1,0

"Conversion to sirolimus ameliorates cyclosporine-induced nephropathy in the rat: focus on serum, urine, gene, and protein renal expression biomarkers. Protocols of conversion from cyclosporin A (CsA) to sirolimus (SRL) have been widely used in immunotherapy after transplantation to prevent CsA-induced nephropathy, but the molecular mechanisms underlying these protocols remain nuclear. This study aimed to identify the molecular pathways and putative biomarkers of CsA-to-SRL conversion in a rat model. Four animal groups (n = 6) were tested during 9 weeks: control, CsA, SRL, and conversion (CsA for 3 weeks followed by SRL for 6 weeks). Classical and emergent serum, urinary, and kidney tissue (gene and protein expression) markers were assessed. Renal lesions were analyzed in hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson's trichrome stains. SRL-treated rats presented proteinuria and NGAL (serum and urinary) as the best markers of renal impairment. Short CsA treatment presented slight or even absent kidney lesions and TGF-b, NF- kb, mTOR, PCNA, TP53, KIM-1, and CTGF as relevant gene and protein changes. Prolonged CsA exposure aggravated renal damage, without clear changes on the traditional markers, but with changes in serums TGF- b and IL-7, TBARs clearance, and kidney TGF-b and mTOR. Conversion to SRL prevented CsA-induced renal damage evolution (absent/mild grade lesions), while NGAL (serum versus urine) seems to be a feasible biomarker of CsA replacement to SRL.",0,1,1,0

"Hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti-diuretic hormone reported with the use of Vincristine: an over-representation of Asians?. PURPOSE: This retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company's global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti-diuretic hormone (SIADH) among vincristine-treated patients and to explore the possibility of at-risk population subgroups. METHOD: We searched the Eli Lilly and Company's computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH as of 1 November 1999 that had been reported during the use of vincristine. RESULTS: A total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use were identified. The overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3/100,000 treated patients. The average age of patients was 35.6 +/- 28.3 years, and 62% were males. Approximately 75% of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymphoma. Among the 39 reports that included information on race, the racial distribution was: 1 Black, 3 Caucasian, and 35 Asian. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that Asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH associated with vincristine use. Although the overall reported rate of SIADH associated with vincristine is very low, physicians caring for Asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event.",0,0,0,1
"Assessment of a new non-invasive index of cardiac performance for detection of dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. BACKGROUND: Electrocardiography has a very low sensitivity in detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia. OBJECTIVES: To assess the added diagnostic value of a new cardiac performance index (dP/dtejc) measurement, based on brachial artery flow changes, as compared to standard 12-lead ECG, for detecting dobutamine-induced myocardial ischemia, using Tc99m-Sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography as the gold standard of comparison to assess the presence or absence of ischemia. METHODS: The study group comprised 40 patients undergoing Sestamibi-SPECT/dobutamine stress test. Simultaneous measurements of ECG and brachial artery dP/dtejc were performed at each dobutamine level. In 19 of the 40 patients perfusion defects compatible with ischemia were detected on SPECT. The increase in dP/dtejc during infusion of dobutamine in this group was severely impaired as compared to the non-ischemic group. dP/dtejc outcome was combined with the ECG results, giving an ECG-enhanced value, and compared to ECG alone. RESULTS: The sensitivity improved dramatically from 16% to 79%, positive predictive value increased from 60% to 68% and negative predictive value from 54% to 78%, and specificity decreased from 90% to 67%. CONCLUSIONS: If ECG alone is used for specificity, the combination with dP/dtejc improved the sensitivity of the test and could be a cost-savings alternative to cardiac imaging or perfusion studies to detect myocardial ischemia, especially in patients unable to exercise.",1,0,0,0

"Severe congestive heart failure patient on amiodarone presenting with myxedemic coma: a case report. This is a case report of myxedema coma secondary to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism in a patient with severe congestive heart failure (CHF). To our knowledge and after reviewing the literature there is one case report of myxedema coma during long term amiodarone therapy. Myxedema coma is a life threatening condition that carries a mortality reaching as high as 20% with treatment. The condition is treated with intravenous thyroxine (T4) or intravenous tri-iodo-thyronine (T3). Patients with CHF on amiodarone may suffer serious morbidity and mortality from hypothyroidism, and thus may deserve closer follow up for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels. This case report carries an important clinical application given the frequent usage of amiodarone among CHF patients. The myriad clinical presentation of myxedema coma and its serious morbidity and mortality stresses the need to suspect this clinical syndrome among CHF patients presenting with hypotension, weakness or other unexplained symptoms.",1,0,1,0
"Absence of effect of sertraline on time-based sensitization of cognitive impairment with haloperidol. This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjects. METHOD: All subjects received placebo on Day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on Days 2 and 25. From Days 9 to 25, subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline (12 subjects) or placebo (12 subjects); the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg/day from Days 9 to 16, and remained at 200 mg/day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period. Cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24-hour period after dosing on Days 1, 2, and 25. RESULTS: Impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on Day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dosing. When single-dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later, greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups, suggesting enhancement of this effect. There was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo group. Three subjects (2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo) withdrew from the study because of side effects. Ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treatment. The side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were similar. CONCLUSION: Haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration.",0,0,1,0

"Functional consequences of mutations in the early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) correlate with severity of human myelinopathies. The early growth response 2 gene ( EGR2 ) is a Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor which is thought to play a role in the regulation of peripheral nervous system myelination . This idea is based partly on the phenotype of homozygous Krox20 ( Egr2 ) knockout mice , which display hypomyelination of the PNS and a block of Schwann cells at an early stage of differentiation . Mutations in the human EGR2 gene have recently been associated with the inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1 , Dejerine-Sottas syndrome and congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy . Three of the four EGR2 mutations are dominant and occur within the zinc finger DNA-binding domain . The fourth mutation is recessive and affects the inhibitory domain ( R1 ) that binds the NAB transcriptional co-repressors . A combination of DNA-binding assays and transcriptional analysis was used to determine the functional consequences of these mutations . The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding and the amount of residual binding directly correlates with disease severity . The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction of EGR2 with the NAB co-repressors and thereby increases transcriptional activity . These data provide insight into the possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations and the reason for varying severity and differences in inheritance patterns . .",0,0,1,0

"Cardiac Angiography in Renally Impaired Patients (CARE) study: a randomized double-blind trial of contrast-induced nephropathy in patients with chronic kidney disease. BACKGROUND: No direct comparisons exist of the renal tolerability of the low-osmolality contrast medium iopamidol with that of the iso-osmolality contrast medium iodixanol in high-risk patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: The present study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind comparison of iopamidol and iodixanol in patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 20 to 59 mL/min) who underwent cardiac angiography or percutaneous coronary interventions. Serum creatinine (SCr) levels and estimated glomerular filtration rate were assessed at baseline and 2 to 5 days after receiving medications. The primary outcome was a postdose SCr increase > or = 0.5 mg/dL (44.2 micromol/L) over baseline. Secondary outcomes were a postdose SCr increase > or = 25%, a postdose estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease of > or = 25%, and the mean peak change in SCr. In 414 patients, contrast volume, presence of diabetes mellitus, use of N-acetylcysteine, mean baseline SCr, and estimated glomerular filtration rate were comparable in the 2 groups. SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL occurred in 4.4% (9 of 204 patients) after iopamidol and 6.7% (14 of 210 patients) after iodixanol (P=0.39), whereas rates of SCr increases > or = 25% were 9.8% and 12.4%, respectively (P=0.44). In patients with diabetes, SCr increases > or = 0.5 mg/dL were 5.1% (4 of 78 patients) with iopamidol and 13.0% (12 of 92 patients) with iodixanol (P=0.11), whereas SCr increases > or = 25% were 10.3% and 15.2%, respectively (P=0.37). Mean post-SCr increases were significantly less with iopamidol (all patients: 0.07 versus 0.12 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 10.6 micromol/L, P=0.03; patients with diabetes: 0.07 versus 0.16 mg/dL, 6.2 versus 14.1 micromol/L, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The rate of contrast-induced nephropathy, defined by multiple end points, is not statistically different after the intraarterial administration of iopamidol or iodixanol to high-risk patients, with or without diabetes mellitus.

"X inactivation and somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying a Piga-null mutation. A somatic mutation in the X linked PIGA gene is responsible for the deficiency of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) -anchored proteins on blood cells from patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . No inherited form of GPI-anchor deficiency has been described . Because conventional Piga gene knockout is associated with high embryonic lethality in chimeric mice , we used the Cre / loxP system . We generated mice in which two loxP sites flank part of Piga exon 2 . After crossbreeding with female mice of the EIIa-cre strain , the floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination with high efficiency during early embryonic development . Because of X chromosome inactivation , female offspring are mosaic for cells that express or lack GPI-linked proteins .

"Long-term prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver failure remains unknown. AIM: To examine whether paracetamol-induced acute liver failure increases long-term mortality. METHODS: We followed up all transplant-free survivors of paracetamol-induced acute liver injury, hospitalized in a Danish national referral centre during 1984-2004. We compared age-specific mortality rates from 1 year post-discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not. RESULTS: We included 641 patients. On average, age-specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol-induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure (adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70, 95% CI 1.02-2.85), but the association was age-dependent, and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease, whereas suicides were frequent in both groups. These observations speak against long-term effects of acute liver failure. More likely, the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver failure. CONCLUSIONS: Paracetamol-induced acute liver failure did not affect long-term mortality. Clinical follow-up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure, but not by the liver failure itself.",0,1,0,0

To determine if a cathepsin C mutation is also responsible for HMS , we sequenced the gene in affected and unaffected subjects from the Cochin isolate in which both the PLS and HMS phenotypes appear . Here we report identification of a mutation of cathepsin C ( exon 6 , 2127A-- > G ) that changes a highly conserved amino acid in the cathepsin C peptide . This mutation segregates with HMS in four nuclear families . Additionally , the existence of a shared common haplotype for genetic loci flanking the cathepsin C gene suggests that affected subjects descended from the Cochin isolate are homozygous for a mutation inherited "" identical by descent "" from a common ancestor . This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance for HMS in these families . We also report a mutation of the same exon 6 CTSC codon ( 2126C-- > T ) in a Turkish family with classical PLS . These findings provide evidence that PLS and HMS are allelic variants of cathepsin C gene mutations . .",0,0,1,0

Immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament (NF) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class, NF-M and NF-H, was used to study axonal injury in the borderzone of focal lesions in rats. Focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid pH or by stab caused by needle insertion. Infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticulata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus. Immunohistochemical staining for NFs showed characteristic terminal clubs of axons in the borderzone of lesions. Differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of NFs and phosphorylation state. These immunohistochemical changes of NFs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions.",0,0,1,0

"Liposomal daunorubicin in advanced Kaposi's sarcoma: a phase II study. We report a non-randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy and safety of liposomal daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in the treatment of AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma. Eleven homosexual men with advanced Kaposi's sarcoma were entered in the trial. Changes in size, colour and associated oedema of selected 'target' lesions were measured. Clinical, biochemical and haematological toxicities were assessed. Ten subjects were evaluated. A partial response was achieved in four, of whom two subsequently relapsed. Stabilization of Kaposi's sarcoma occurred in the remaining six, maintained until the end of the trial period in four. The drug was generally well tolerated, with few mild symptoms of toxicity. The main problem encountered was haematological toxicity, with three subjects experiencing severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/l). There was no evidence of cardiotoxicity. In this small patient sample, liposomal daunorubicin was an effective and well tolerated agent in the treatment of Kaposi's sarcoma.",1,0,1,1
"Abnormal myotonic dystrophy protein kinase levels produce only mild myopathy in mice. Myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) is commonly associated with CTG repeat expansions within the gene for DM-protein kinase ( DMPK ) . The effect of altered expression levels of DMPK , which is ubiquitously expressed in all muscle cell lineages during development , was examined by disrupting the endogenous Dmpk gene and overexpressing a normal human DMPK transgene in mice . Nullizygous ( - / - ) mice showed only inconsistent and minor size changes in head and neck muscle fibres at older age , animals with the highest DMPK transgene expression showed hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and enhanced neonatal mortality . However , both models lack other frequent DM symptoms including the fibre-type dependent atrophy , myotonia , cataract and male-infertility .

"Increased serum soluble Fas in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the Fas/Fas Ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver failure. The aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of Fas in patients with acute liver failure. METHODOLOGY: Serum levels of sFas (soluble Fas) were measured by ELISA in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjects. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma were also determined by ELISA. RESULTS: Serum sFas was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure (median, 26.8 U/mL; range, 6.9-52.7 U/mL) compared to the normal controls (median, 8.6 U/mL; range, 6.5-12.0 U/mL, P < 0.0001). Levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose (median, 28.7 U/mL; range, 12.8-52.7 U/mL, n = 17) than those due to non-A to E hepatitis (median, 12.5 U/mL; range, 6.9-46.0 U/mL, n = 7, P < 0.01). There was no relationship of sFas to eventual outcome in the patients. A significant correlation was observed between serum sFas levels and aspartate aminotransferase (r = 0.613, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The increased concentration of sFas in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of Fas-mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss.",0,1,1,1

"Fluconazole-induced torsade de pointes. OBJECTIVE: To present a case of fluconazole-associated torsade de pointes (TDP) and discuss fluconazole's role in causing TDP. CASE SUMMARY: A 68-year-old white woman with Candida glabrata isolated from a presacral abscess developed TDP eight days after commencing oral fluconazole The patient had no other risk factors for TDP, including coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure, and electrolyte abnormalities There was a temporal association between the initiation of fluconazole and TDP. The TDP resolved when fluconazole was discontinued; however, the patient continued to have premature ventricular contractions and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) until six days after drug cessation DISCUSSION: Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicates a probable relationship between the use of fluconazole and the development of TDP. The possible mechanism is depression of rapidly activating delayed rectifier potassium currents. In our patient, there was no other etiology identified that could explain QT prolongation or TDP The complete disappearance of NSVT and premature ventricular contractions followed by normalization of QT interval after the drug was stopped strongly suggests fluconazole as the etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians should be aware that fluconazole, even at low doses, may cause prolongation of the QT interval, leading to TDP. Serial electrocardiographic monitoring may be considered when fluconazole is administered in patients who are at risk for ventricular arrhythmias.",1,0,0,0

"Paternal transmission of congenital myotonic dystrophy. We report a rare case of paternally transmitted congenital myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) . The proband is a 23 year old , mentally retarded male who suffers severe muscular weakness . He presented with respiratory and feeding difficulties at birth . His two sibs suffer from childhood onset DM . Their late father had the adult type of DM , with onset around 30 years . Only six other cases of paternal transmission of congenital DM have been reported recently . We review the sex related effects on transmission of congenital DM . Decreased fertility of males with adult onset DM and contraction of the repeat upon male transmission contribute to the almost absent occurrence of paternal transmission of congenital DM . Also the fathers of the reported congenitally affected children showed , on average , shorter CTG repeat lengths and hence less severe clinical symptoms than the mothers of children with congenital DM . We conclude that paternal transmission of congenital DM is rare and preferentially occurs with onset of DM past 30 years in the father . .",0,0,1,0
"Diseases of peripheral nerves as seen in the Nigerian African. The anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders, as seen in 358 Nigerians are presented. There is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth decade. Sensori-motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation (50%). Guillain-Barr   syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause (15.6%), accounting for half of the cases with motor neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common (10.1%) and presented mainly as sensory and sensori-motor neuropathy. Diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuropathy. Isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug-induced neuropathy. Migraine (20%) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticuloendothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent (26%). In 26.5% of all the cases, the aetiology of the neuropathy was undetermined. Heredofamilial and connective tissue disorders were rare.

"Cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity. The influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine-and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was examined in mice. All adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice, and the effects were dose-dependent. It seems that adenosine A1 and A2 receptors might be involved in this reaction. Moreover, all adenosine receptor agonists: 2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenethylamino-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS 21680), A2A receptor agonist, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), A1 receptor agonist, and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), A2/A1 receptor agonist significantly and dose-dependently decreased cocaine-induced locomotor activity. CPA reduced cocaine action at the doses which, given alone, did not influence motility, while CGS 21680 and NECA decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which, given alone, decreased locomotor activity in animals. These results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of A1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptor by DMPX (3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine) significantly enhanced cocaine-induced locomotor activity of animals. Caffeine had similar action but the effect was not significant. CPT (8-cyclopentyltheophylline)--A1 receptor antagonist, did not show any influence in this test. Similarly, all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine-induced hyperactivity. The selective blockade of A2 adenosine receptors (DMPX) and non-selective blockade of adenosine receptors (caffeine) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test. Our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists (A1 and A2) reduce cocaine- and amphetamine-induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine-induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists (particularly A1 receptors) than amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.",0,0,1,0
"Phase II trial of vinorelbine in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gastrointestinal Treat Cancer Cooperative Group. PURPOSE: To evaluate the response rate and toxic effects of vinorelbine (VNB) administered as a single agent in metastatic squamous cell esophageal carcinoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients with measurable lesions were included and were stratified according to previous chemotherapy. Thirty patients without prior chemotherapy and 16 pretreated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy were assessable for toxicity and response. VNB was administered weekly as a 25-mg/m2 short intravenous (i.v.) infusion. RESULTS: Six of 30 patients (20%) without prior chemotherapy achieved a partial response (PR) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8% to 39%). The median duration of response was 21 weeks (range, 17 to 28). One of 16 patients (6%) with prior chemotherapy had a complete response (CR) of 31 weeks' duration (95% CI, 0% to 30%). The overall response rate (World Health Organization [WHO] criteria) was 15% (CR, 2%; PR 13%; 95% CI, 6% to 29%). The median dose-intensity (DI) was 20 mg/m2/wk. VNB was well tolerated and zero instances of WHO grade 4 nonhematologic toxicity occurred. At least one episode of grade 3 or 4 granulocytopenia was seen in 59% of patients. A grade 2 or 3 infection occurred in 16% of patients, but no toxic deaths occurred. Other side effects were rare, and peripheral neurotoxicity has been minor (26% grade 1). CONCLUSION: These data indicate that VNB is an active agent in metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Given its excellent tolerance profile and low toxicity, further evaluation of VNB in combination therapy is warranted.",0,0,1,1
"Risks and benefits of COX-2 inhibitors vs non-selective NSAIDs: does their cardiovascular risk exceed their gastrointestinal benefit? A retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVES: The risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with COX-2 inhibitors may offset their gastrointestinal (GI) benefit compared with non-selective (NS) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We aimed to compare the risks of hospitalization for AMI and GI bleeding among elderly patients using COX-2 inhibitors, NS-NSAIDs and acetaminophen. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using administrative data of patients > or =65 years of age who filled a prescription for NSAID or acetaminophen during 1999-2002. Outcomes were compared using Cox regression models with time-dependent exposures. RESULTS: Person-years of exposure among non-users of aspirin were: 75,761 to acetaminophen, 42,671 to rofecoxib 65,860 to celecoxib, and 37,495 to NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, they were: 14,671 to rofecoxib, 22,875 to celecoxib, 9,832 to NS-NSAIDs and 38,048 to acetaminophen. Among non-users of aspirin, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence interval) of hospitalization for AMI/GI vs the acetaminophen (with no aspirin) group were: rofecoxib 1.27 (1.13, 1.42), celecoxib 0.93 (0.83, 1.03), naproxen 1.59 (1.31, 1.93), diclofenac 1.17 (0.99, 1.38) and ibuprofen 1.05 (0.74, 1.51). Among users of aspirin, they were: rofecoxib 1.73 (1.52, 1.98), celecoxib 1.34 (1.19, 1.52), ibuprofen 1.51 (0.95, 2.41), diclofenac 1.69 (1.35, 2.10), naproxen 1.35 (0.97, 1.88) and acetaminophen 1.29 (1.17, 1.42). CONCLUSION: Among non-users of aspirin, naproxen seemed to carry the highest risk for AMI/GI bleeding. The AMI/GI toxicity of celecoxib was similar to that of acetaminophen and seemed to be better than those of rofecoxib and NS-NSAIDs. Among users of aspirin, both celecoxib and naproxen seemed to be the least toxic.",1,0,0,0

"The alpha3 and beta4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits are necessary for nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in mice. Binding of nicotine to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) elicits a series of dose-dependent behaviors that go from altered exploration, sedation, and tremors, to seizures and death. nAChRs are pentameric ion channels usually composed of alpha and beta subunits. A gene cluster comprises the alpha3, alpha5 and beta4 subunits, which coassemble to form functional receptors. We examined the role of the beta4 subunits in nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion in beta4 homozygous null (beta4 -/-) and alpha3 heterozygous (+/-) mice. beta4 -/- mice were less sensitive to the effects of nicotine both at low doses, measured as decreased exploration in an open field, and at high doses, measured as sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures. Using in situ hybridization probes for the alpha3 and alpha5 subunits, we showed that alpha5 mRNA levels are unchanged, whereas alpha3 mRNA levels are selectively decreased in the mitral cell layer of the olfactory bulb, and the inferior and the superior colliculus of beta4 -/- brains. alpha3 +/- mice were partially resistant to nicotine-induced seizures when compared to wild-type littermates. mRNA levels for the alpha5 and the beta4 subunits were unchanged in alpha3 +/- brains. Together, these results suggest that the beta4 and the alpha3 subunits are mediators of nicotine-induced seizures and hypolocomotion.",0,0,1,0
"Dexrazoxane protects against myelosuppression from the DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not doxorubicin. PURPOSE: The anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epipodophyllotoxin etoposide are potent DNA cleavage-enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology; however, myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use. Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187) is recommended for protection against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Because of their widespread use, the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dexrazoxane and these three structurally different DNA cleavage enhancers was investigated: Sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin +/- dexrazoxane was determined in granulocyte-macrophage colony forming assays. Likewise, in vivo, B6D2F1 mice were treated with etoposide, daunorubicin, and doxorubicin, with or without dexrazoxane over a wide range of doses: posttreatment, a full hematologic evaluation was done. RESULTS: Nontoxic doses of dexrazoxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay; however, dexrazoxane neither reduced myelosuppression, weight loss, nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from doxorubicin. CONCLUSION: Although our findings support the observation that dexrazoxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically, the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed attention. Our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dexrazoxane. Clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dexrazoxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggravating hematologic toxicity. If successful, this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy.",1,0,1,1
"Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus associated with a missense mutation encoding Gly23-->Val in neurophysin II. Autosomal dominant neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus ( ADNDI ) is an inherited disease caused by progressive degeneration of the magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamus leading to decreased ability to produce the hormone arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) . Affected individuals are not symptomatic at birth , but usually develop diabetes insipidus at 1-6 yr of age . The genetic locus of the disease is the AVP-neurophysin II ( NPII ) gene , and mutations that cause ADNDI have been found in both the signal peptide of the prepro-AVP-NPII precursor and within NPII itself . An affected girl who presented at 9 months of age and her similarly affected younger brother and father were all found to have a novel missense mutation ( G1758-- > T ) encoding the amino acid substitution Gly23-- > Val within NPII . The mutation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease analysis . A T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the fathers pituitary gland demonstrates an attenuated posterior pituitary bright spot . This mutation may be valuable for developing models of dominantly inherited neurodegeneration , as the early age of onset of symptoms suggests that this mutation may be particularly deleterious to the magnocellular neuron . .",0,0,1,0

"Reversal by phenylephrine of the beneficial effects of intravenous nitroglycerin in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Nitroglycerin has been shown to reduce ST-segment elevation during acute myocardial infarction, an effect potentiated in the dog by agents that reverse nitroglycerin-induced hypotension. Our study was designed to determine the effects of combined nitroglycerin and phenylephrine therapy. Ten patients with acute transmural myocardial infarctions received intravenous nitroglycerin, sufficient to reduce mean arterial pressure from 107 +/- 6 to 85 +/- 6 mm Hg (P less than 0.001), for 60 minutes. Left ventricular filling pressure decreased from 19 +/- 2 to 11 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.001). SigmaST, the sum of ST-segment elevations in 16 precordial leads, decreased (P less than 0.02) with intravenous nitroglycerin. Subsequent addition of phenylephrine infusion, sufficient to re-elevate mean arterial pressure to 106 +/- 4 mm Hg (P less than 0.001) for 30 minutes, increased left ventricular filling pressure to 17 +/- 2 mm Hg (P less than 0.05) and also significantly increased sigmaST (P less than 0.05).

"Frequent detection of codon 877 mutation in the androgen receptor gene in advanced prostate cancers. Prostatic tissue specimens derived from transurethral resections of patients with metastatic prostate cancer were analyzed for genetic alterations in the hormone-binding domain of the androgen receptor ( AR ) gene . Direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction-derived DNAs of 6 of 24 specimens revealed a codon 877 mutation ( ACT-- > GCT , Thr-- > Ala ) in the hormone-binding domain of the AR gene . This same AR mutation has been reported previously in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line , LNCaP , where this mutation confers upon the AR an altered ligand-binding specificity which is stimulated by estrogens , progestagens , and antiandrogens . It is possible that analogous to an activated / altered growth factor receptor oncogene , codon 877 mutant AR with altered ligand binding may provide a selective growth advantage in the genesis of a subset of advanced prostate cancer . Although estrogens are used infrequently , antiandrogens are used increasingly in hormonal therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer . The stimulatory effect of these therapeutic agents on the codon 877 mutant AR further suggests that this frequently observed AR mutation may contribute to the treatment refractory disease . .",0,0,0,1
"Delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia: effect on brain edema. The effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2-h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studied. Under isoflurane anesthesia, the MCA of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was occluded. In the control group (n = 7), the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group (n = 7), the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg beginning 2 h after MCAO. Four hours after MCAO, the rats were killed and the brains harvested. The brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by MCAO. Specific gravity (SG) was determined in the subcortex and in two sites in the cortex (core and periphery of the ischemic territory). The extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining. In the ischemic core, there was no difference in SG in the subcortex and cortex in the two groups. In the periphery of the ischemic territory, SG in the cortex was greater (less edema accumulation) in the hypertensive group (1.041 +/- 0.001 vs 1.039 +/- 0.001, P less than 0.05). The area of histochemical injury (as a percent of the cross-sectional area of the hemisphere) was less in the hypertensive group (33 +/- 3% vs 21 +/- 2%, P less than 0.05). The data indicate that phenylephrine-induced hypertension instituted 2 h after MCAO does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core, that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory, and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction.",1,0,1,0

"Submicroscopic deletions at the WAGR locus, revealed by nonradioactive in situ hybridization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) with biotin-labeled probes mapping to 11p13 has been used for the molecular analysis of deletions of the WAGR ( Wilms tumor , aniridia , genitourinary abnormalities , and mental retardation ) locus . We have detected a submicroscopic 11p13 deletion in a child with inherited aniridia who subsequently presented with Wilms tumor in a horseshoe kidney , only revealed at surgery . The mother , who has aniridia , was also found to carry a deletion including both the aniridia candidate gene ( AN2 ) and the Wilms tumor predisposition gene ( WT1 ) . This is therefore a rare case of an inherited WAGR deletion . Wilms tumor has so far only been associated with sporadic de novo aniridia cases . We have shown that a cosmid probe for a candidate aniridia gene , homologous to the mouse Pax-6 gene , is deleted in cell lines from aniridia patients with previously characterized deletions at 11p13 , while another cosmid marker mapping between two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints ( and hence a second candidate marker ) is present on both chromosomes .

Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and effective renal plasma flow (ERPF) were measured by inulin and para-aminohippurate (PAH) clearance, respectively. Anesthesia was maintained with fentanyl, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and isoflurane. Hypotension was induced for 236.9 +/- 15.1 min by increasing the isoflurane inspired concentration to maintain a mean arterial pressure of 59.8 +/- 0.4 mmHg. GFR and ERPF decreased with the induction of anesthesia but not significantly more during hypotension. Postoperatively, ERPF returned to preoperative values, whereas GFR was higher than preoperative values. Renal vascular resistance increased during anesthesia but decreased when hypotension was induced, allowing the maintenance of renal blood flow. We conclude that renal compensatory mechanisms are preserved during isoflurane-induced hypotension and that renal function and hemodynamics quickly return to normal when normotension is resumed.",0,1,1,0
"Somatic mutations in the BRCA1 gene in sporadic ovarian tumours. The BRCA1 gene on chromosome 17q21 is responsible for an autosomal dominant syndrome of increased susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer but no somatic mutations in tumours have yet been described . To study the potential role of BRCA1 in sporadic carcinogenesis , we analysed the genomic DNA of tumour and normal fractions of 47 ovarian cancers for mutations in BRCA1 using the single-strand conformation polymorphism technique . We now describe somatic mutations in the DNA of four tumours which also had loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) at a BRCA1 intragenic marker . Our data support a tumour suppressor mechanism for BRCA1 ; somatic mutations and LOH may result in inactivation of BRCA1 in at least a small number of ovarian cancers . .",0,0,0,1

"Nelarabine neurotoxicity with concurrent intrathecal chemotherapy: Case report and review of literature. Severe nelarabine neurotoxicity in a patient who received concurrent intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy is reported. A 37-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was admitted for relapsed disease. She was originally treated with induction chemotherapy followed by an autologous transplant. She developed relapsed disease 10 months later with leukemic involvement. She was re-induced with nelarabine 1500 mg/m(2) on days 1, 3, and 5 with 1 dose of IT cytarabine 100 mg on day 2 as central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis. At the time of treatment, she was on continuous renal replacement therapy due to sequelae of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS). She tolerated therapy well, entered a complete remission, and recovered her renal function. She received a second cycle of nelarabine without additional IT prophylaxis one month later. A week after this second cycle, she noted numbness in her lower extremities. Predominantly sensory, though also motor and autonomic, peripheral neuropathy started in her feet, ascended proximally to the mid-thoracic region, and eventually included her distal upper extremities. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her spine demonstrated changes from C2 to C6 consistent with subacute combined degeneration. Nelarabine was felt to be the cause of her symptoms. Her neuropathy stabilized and showed slight improvement and ultimately received an unrelated, reduced-intensity allogeneic transplant while in complete remission, but relapsed disease 10 weeks later. She is currently being treated with best supportive care. To our knowledge, this is the first published case report of severe neurotoxicity caused by nelarabine in a patient who received concurrent IT chemotherapy.",0,1,1,1

"ATM mutations and phenotypes in ataxia-telangiectasia families in the British Isles: expression of mutant ATM and the risk of leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer. We report the spectrum of 59 ATM mutations observed in ataxia-telangiectasia ( A-T ) patients in the British Isles . Of 51 ATM mutations identified in families native to the British Isles , 11 were founder mutations , and 2 of these 11 conferred a milder clinical phenotype with respect to both cerebellar degeneration and cellular features . We report , in two A-T families , an ATM mutation ( 7271T-- > G ) that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both homozygotes and heterozygotes ( relative risk 12 . 7 ; P = . 0025 ) , although there is a less severe A-T phenotype in terms of the degree of cerebellar degeneration . This mutation ( 7271T-- > G ) also allows expression of full-length ATM protein at a level comparable with that in unaffected individuals . In addition , we have studied 18 A-T patients , in 15 families , who developed leukemia , lymphoma , preleukemic T-cell proliferation , or Hodgkin lymphoma , mostly in childhood .

"The haemodynamic effects of propofol in combination with ephedrine in elderly patients (ASA groups 3 and 4). The marked vasodilator and negative inotropic effects of propofol are disadvantages in frail elderly patients. We investigated the safety and efficacy of adding different doses of ephedrine to propofol in order to obtund the hypotensive response. The haemodynamic effects of adding 15, 20 or 25 mg of ephedrine to 200 mg of propofol were compared to control in 40 ASA 3/4 patients over 60 years presenting for genito-urinary surgery. The addition of ephedrine to propofol appears to be an effective method of obtunding the hypotensive response to propofol at all doses used in this study. However, marked tachycardia associated with the use of ephedrine in combination with propofol occurred in the majority of patients, occasionally reaching high levels in individual patients. Due to the risk of this tachycardia inducing myocardial ischemia, we would not recommend the use in elderly patients of any of the ephedrine/propofol/mixtures studied.",1,0,0,0

"Peripheral neuropathy caused by high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia. The central nervous system toxicity of high-dose cytosine arabinoside is well recognized, but the toxicity of cytosine arabinoside in the peripheral nervous system has been infrequently reported. A 49-year-old Japanese man was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After he achieved complete remission, he received high-dose cytosine arabinoside treatment (2 g/m2 twice a day for 5 days; total, 20 g/m2) as consolidation therapy. The first course of high-dose cytosine arabinoside resulted in no unusual symptoms, but on day 21 of the second course of treatment, the patient complained of numbness in his right foot. Electromyogram and nerve-conduction studies showed peripheral neuropathy in both peroneal nerves. This neuropathy was gradually resolving; however, after the patient received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, the symptoms worsened, with the development of graft-versus-host disease, and the symptoms subsequently responded to methylprednisolone. Although the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathy are still unclear, high-dose cytosine arabinoside is a therapy that is potentially toxic to the peripheral nervous system, and auto/alloimmunity may play an important role in these mechanisms.",0,0,1,1

"Pulmonary edema and shock after high-dose aracytine-C for lymphoma; possible role of TNF-alpha and PAF. Four out of 23 consecutive patients treated with high-dose Ara-C for lymphomas in our institution developed a strikingly similar syndrome during the perfusion. It was characterized by the onset of fever, diarrhea, shock, pulmonary edema, acute renal failure, metabolic acidosis, weight gain and leukocytosis. Thorough bacteriological screening failed to provide evidence of infection. Sequential biological assays of IL-1, IL-2, TNF and PAF were performed during Ara-C infusion to ten patients, including the four who developed the syndrome. TNF and PAF activity was found in the serum of respectively two and four of the cases, but not in the six controls. As TNF and PAF are thought to be involved in the development of septic shock and adult respiratory distress syndrome, we hypothesize that high-dose Ara-C may be associated with cytokine release.",0,1,0,1
"Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha target gene activation. Amiodarone, an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent, has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients. To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect, mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation. Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly, hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation, and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose. Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose-dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation, lipoprotein assembly, and lipid transport. Many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor. The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [PPARalpha-/-] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene. Compared to wild-type mice, treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss. The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect. Based upon these results, we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect. These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity.",0,1,0,0

Myo-inositol-1-phosphate (MIP) synthase inhibition: in-vivo study in rats. Lithium and valproate are the prototypic mood stabilizers and have diverse structures and targets. Both drugs influence inositol metabolism. Lithium inhibits IMPase and valproate inhibits MIP synthase. This study shows that MIP synthase inhibition does not replicate or augment the effects of lithium in the inositol sensitive pilocarpine-induced seizures model. This lack of effects may stem from the low contribution of de-novo synthesis to cellular inositol supply or to the inhibition of the de-novo synthesis by lithium itself.,0,0,1,0
"Induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat. Effects on hepatocyte fine structure. Groups of male and female inbred Leeds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5% or 1.0% paracetamol by weight for up to 18 months. At the 1.0% dosage level, 20% of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver, a statistically significant incidence. These rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration, the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rats. Papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol-treated groups, and three rats bore bladder carcinomas. However, significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage males. Additionally, 20 to 25% of paracetamol-treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium, which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calculi. A low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feeding.

"Blockade of endothelial-mesenchymal transition by a Smad3 inhibitor delays the early development of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. OBJECTIVE: A multicenter, controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy, suggesting that other mechanism(s) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy (diabetic nephropathy). We have previously demonstrated that endothelial-mesenchymal-transition (EndoMT) contributes to the early development of renal interstitial fibrosis independently of microalbuminuria in mice with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. In the present study, we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: EndoMT was induced in a mouse pancreatic microvascular endothelial cell line (MMEC) in the presence of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and in the endothelial lineage-traceble mouse line Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP by administration of AGEs, with nonglycated mouse albumin serving as a control. Phosphorylated Smad3 was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 (SIS3) were performed in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. RESULTS: Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR demonstrated that AGEs induced EndoMT in MMECs and in Tie2-Cre;Loxp-EGFP mice. Immunoprecipitation/Western blotting showed that Smad3 was activated by AGEs but was inhibited by SIS3 in MMECs and in STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR further demonstrated that SIS3 abrogated EndoMT, reduced renal fibrosis, and retarded progression of nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: EndoMT is a novel pathway leading to early development of diabetic nephropathy. Blockade of EndoMT by SIS3 may provide a new strategy to retard the progression of diabetic nephropathy and other diabetes complications.",0,1,0,0
"Effect of D-Glucarates on basic antibiotic-induced renal damage in rats. Dehydrated rats regularly develop acute renal failure following single injection of aminoglycoside antibiotics combined with dextran or of antibiotics only. Oral administration of 2,5-di-O-acetyl-D-glucaro-1,4-6,3-dilactone protected rats against renal failure induced by kanamycin-dextran. The protective effect was prevalent among D-glucarates, and also to other saccharic acid, hexauronic acids and hexaaldonic acids, although to a lesser degree, but not to a hexaaldose, sugar alcohols, substances inthe TCA cycle and other acidic compounds. D-Glucarates were effective against renal damage induced by peptide antibiotics as well as various aminoglycoside antibitocis. Dose-responses were observed in the protective effect of D-Glucarates. With a D-glucarate of a fixed size of dose, approximately the same degree of protection was obtained against renal damages induced by different basic antibiotics despite large disparities in administration doses of different antibiotics. D-Glucarates had the ability to prevent renal damage but not to cure it. Rats excreted acidic urine when they were spared from renal lesions by monosaccharides.

"Crocin improves lipid dysregulation in subacute diazinon exposure through ERK1/2 pathway in rat liver. INTRODUCTION: Diazinon Yis one of the most broadly used organophosphorus insecticides in agriculture. It has been shown that exposure to diazinon may interfere with lipid metabolism. Moreover, the hypolipidemic effect of crocin has been established. Earlier studies revealed the major role of Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways in low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in the regulation of lipid metabolism, ERK and LDLr expression in the liver of rats exposed to subacute diazinon. Furthermore ameliorating effect of crocin on diazinon induced disturbed cholesterol homeostasis was studied. METHODS: 24 Rats were divided into 4 groups and received following treatments for 4 weeks; Corn oil (control), diazinon (15mg/kg per day, orally) and crocin (12.5 and 25mg/kg per day, intraperitoneally) in combination with diazinon (15 mg/kg). The levels of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL in blood of rats were analyzed. Moreover mRNA levels of LDLr and ERK1/2 as well as protein levels of total and activated forms of ERK1/2 in rat liver were evaluated by Western blotting and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction analysis. RESULTS: Our data showed that subacute exposure to diazinon significantly increased concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and LDL. Moreover diazinon decreased ERK1/2 protein phosphorylation and LDLr transcript. Crocin reduced inhibition of ERK activation and diazinon-induced hyperlipemia and increased levels of LDLr transcript. CONCLUSIONS: Crocin may be considered as a novel protective agent in diazinon-induced hyperlipemia through modulating of ERK pathway and increase of LDLr expression.",0,1,1,0

"Changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha-benzene hexachloride. Peroxisomes in hepatomas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha-benzene hexachloride were examined histochemically and electron microscopically. Although most of the hepatomas were well-differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes, the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl-alpha-p-chlorophenoxyisobutyrate with proliferation of peroxisomes. At the 16th week of carcinogen feeding, hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stages. A majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxisomes. Within the nodules, foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appeared. These cells proliferated further, replacing the most part of the nodules, and with this process hepatomas appeared to have been formed.

"The risk and associated factors of methamphetamine psychosis in methamphetamine-dependent patients in Malaysia. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine-induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence. The association between psychiatric co-morbidity and methamphetamine-induced psychosis was also studied. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study conducted concurrently at a teaching hospital and a drug rehabilitation center in Malaysia. Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM-IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (M.I.N.I.) for methamphetamine-induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders. The information on sociodemographic background and drug use history was obtained from interview or medical records. RESULTS: Of 292 subjects, 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms. Co-morbid major depressive disorder (OR=7.18, 95 CI=2.612-19.708), bipolar disorder (OR=13.807, 95 CI=5.194-36.706), antisocial personality disorder (OR=12.619, 95 CI=6.702-23.759) and heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine-induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors. Major depressive disorder (OR=2.870, CI=1.154-7.142) and antisocial personality disorder (OR=3.299, 95 CI=1.375-7.914) were the only factors associated with current psychosis.

We report here the linkage relationship of the myotonic dystrophy ( DM ) locus to twelve of these markers as studied in 45 families with DM . The resulting genetic map is supported by the localisation of the DNA markers in a panel of somatic cell hybrids . Ten of the twelve markers have been shown to be proximal to the DM gene and two , PRKCG and D19S22 , distal but at distances of approximately 25 cM and 15 cM , respectively . The closest proximal markers are APOC2 ( apolipoprotein C-II ) and CKM ( creatine kinase , muscle ) approximately 3 cM and 2 cM from the DM gene respectively , in the order APOC2-CKM-DM . The distance between APOC2 , CKM and DM ( of the order of 2 million base pairs ) and their known orientation should permit directional chromosome walking and jumping . The data presented here should enable us to determine whether or not new markers are distal to APOC2 / CKM and thus potentially flank the DM gene . .",0,0,1,0

"Gemcitabine plus vinorelbine in nonsmall cell lung carcinoma patients age 70 years or older or patients who cannot receive cisplatin. Oncopaz Cooperative Group. BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of nonsmall cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is high among elderly patients, few data are available regarding the efficacy and toxicity of chemotherapy in this group of patients. Recent reports indicate that single agent therapy with vinorelbine (VNB) or gemcitabine (GEM) may obtain a response rate of 20-30% in elderly patients, with acceptable toxicity and improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In the current study the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of GEM and VNB in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC or those with some contraindication to receiving cisplatin were assessed. METHODS: Forty-nine patients with advanced NSCLC were included, 38 of whom were age >/= 70 years and 11 were age < 70 years but who had some contraindication to receiving cisplatin. All patients were evaluable for response and toxicity. Treatment was comprised of VNB, 25 mg/m(2), plus GEM, 1000 mg/m(2), both on Days 1, 8, and 15 every 28 days. Patients received a minimum of three courses unless progressive disease was detected. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five courses were administered, with a median of 3. 6 courses per patient. The overall response rate was 26% (95% confidence interval, 15-41%). Two patients attained a complete response (4%) and 11 patients (22%) achieved a partial response. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status improved in 35% of those patients with an initial value > 0, whereas relief of at least 1 symptom without worsening of other symptoms was noted in 27 patients (55%). The median time to progression was 16 weeks and the 1-year survival rate was 33%. Toxicity was mild. Six patients (12%) had World Health Organization Grade 3-4 neutropenia, 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3-4 thrombocytopenia, and 2 patients (4%) had Grade 3 neurotoxicity. Three patients with severe neutropenia (6%) died of sepsis. The median age of those patients developing Grade 3-4 neutropenia was significantly higher than that of the remaining patients (75 years vs. 72 years; P = 0.047). CONCLUSIONS: The combination of GEM and VNB is moderately active and well tolerated except in patients age >/= 75 years. This age group had an increased risk of myelosuppression. Therefore the prophylactic use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor should be considered with this treatment. New chemotherapy combinations with higher activity and lower toxicity are needed for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC.",0,0,1,1

"Cortical motor overactivation in parkinsonian patients with L-dopa-induced peak-dose dyskinesia. We have studied the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes induced by the execution of a finger-to-thumb opposition motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on L-dopa medication, the first one without L-dopa induced dyskinesia (n = 23) and the other with moderate peak-dose dyskinesia (n = 15), and of a group of 14 normal subjects. Single photon emission tomography with i.v. 133Xe was used to measure the rCBF changes. The dyskinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non-dyskinetic parkinsonian patients, with a significant overactivation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi- and contralateral primary motor areas. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movement, like L-dopa-induced peak dose dyskinesia, is due to a disinhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pallidothalamocortical motor loop.",0,0,1,0

"Thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemotherapy. Five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy (characterized by renal insufficiency, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and usually thrombocytopenia) after treatment with cisplatin, bleomycin, and a vinca alkaloid. One patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, three the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and one an apparent forme fruste of one of these disorders. Histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation, primarily affecting the small arteries, arterioles, and glomeruli. Because each patient was tumor-free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome, the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemotherapy. Diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined, because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug-induced bone marrow suppression.",0,1,0,1

"GT to AT transition at a splice donor site causes skipping of the preceding exon in phenylketonuria. Classical Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) is an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase ( PAH ) . We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones from a PKU carrier individual and showed that they contained an internal 116 base pair deletion , corresponding precisely to exon 12 of the human chromosomal PAH gene . The deletion causes the synthesis of a truncated protein lacking the C-terminal 52 amino acids . Gene transfer and expression studies using the mutant PAH cDNA indicated that the deletion abolishes PAH activity in the cell as a result of protein instability . To determine the molecular basis of the deletion , the mutant chromosomal PAH gene was isolated from this individual and shown to contain a GT-- greater than AT substitution at the 5 splice donor site of intron 12 . Thus , the consequence of the splice donor site mutation in the human liver is the skipping of the preceding exon during RNA splicing . .",0,1,0,0

"Toxic hepatitis induced by antithyroid drugs: four cases including one with cross-reactivity between carbimazole and benzylthiouracil. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with antithyroid drugs. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department (in- or out-patients) from 1986 to 1992. RESULTS: Four patients (1.7%) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of antithyroid agent. Two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carbimazole (N  omercazole). Two others had a mixed (cholestatic and cytolytic) hepatitis following carbimazole. One of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after Benzylthiouracil (Basd  ne) had replaced carbimazole. Biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the incriminated drug, while biliary, viral and immunological searches were negative. Only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutropenia. CONCLUSION: Toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of antithyroid drugs which warrants, as for haematological disturbances, a pre-therapeutic determination and a careful follow-up of relevant biological markers. Moreover, hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of antithyroid agents.",0,1,0,0

"Prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat. Dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary development. The purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rats. Pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone (0.2 mg/kg body weight) on gestational days 11 and 12, 13 and 14, 15 and 16, 17 and 18, or 19 and 20. Offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20% reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age (22 527+/-509 versus 28 050+/-561, P<0.05), which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of age. Six- to 9-month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17% reduction in glomeruli (23 380+/-587) compared with control rats (P<0.05). Male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16, 17 and 18, and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular number. Adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rats. This study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number, glomerulosclerosis, and hypertension when administered at specific points during gestation. Hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number, suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension.",1,1,1,0
"Cocaine-induced brainstem seizures and behavior. A variety of abnormal sensory/motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult WKY rats by mechanical (electrode implants) and DC electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of cocaine. The electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incapacitated by the stimulations. Cocaine (40 mg/kg) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg/kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic study. Cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group, especially the electrically perturbated subjects. The abnormal behaviors were yawning, retrocollis, hyperactivity, hypersensitivity, ""beating drum"" behavior, squealing, head bobbing, circling, sniffing, abnormal posturing, and facial twitching. Shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral states. Hypersensitivity to various auditory, tactile, and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimulation. These findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propagates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and DC electrical perturbation. Cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propagates. Cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated.",0,0,1,0

"Pentoxifylline (Trental) does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia: implications for dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging. Dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease. Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline (Trental), a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication. Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole-thallium-201 imaging is unknown. Therefore, we studied the hyperemic response to dipyridamole in seven open-chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline (0, 7.5, or 15 mg/kg i.v.) or theophylline (3 mg/kg i.v.). Baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment groups. Dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm/kg i.v. pentoxifylline (p less than 0.002). Neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole-induced hyperemia, while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline (p less than 0.01). We conclude that pentoxyifylline does not inhibit dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses.",1,0,0,0
"Differential effects of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats. The muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the forebrain. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, sodium salicylate, phenylbutazone, indomethacin, ibuprofen and mefenamic acid, on seizures produced by pilocarpine. Pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate, ED50 103 mg/kg (60-174), and phenylbutazone, 59 mg/kg (50-70) converted the non-convulsant dose of pilocarpine, 200 mg/kg, to a convulsant one. Indomethacin, 1-10 mg/kg, and ibuprofen, 10-100 mg/kg, failed to modulate seizures produced by pilocarpine. Mefenamic acid, 26 (22-30) mg/kg, prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure-related brain damage induced by pilocarpine, 380 mg/kg. These results indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for pilocarpine-induced seizures.",0,0,1,0

"Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia triggered by salbutamol: case report and review of the literature. CASE: A 49-year-old patient experienced chest discomfort while swallowing. On electrocardiogram, episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing; 24-hour Holter monitoring recorded several events. The arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol, but recurred a year later. The patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhalator of salbutamol. After stopping the beta-agonist, and after a week with the atenolol, the arrhythmia disappeared. DISCUSSION: Swallowing-induced atrial tachyarrhythmia (SIAT) is a rare phenomenon. Fewer than 50 cases of SIAT have been described in the literature. This article summarizes all the cases published, creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to SIAT. It discusses demographics, clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia, postulated mechanisms of SIAT, and different treatment possibilities such as medications, surgery, and radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFCA). CONCLUSION: Salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for SIAT. Although it is difficult to define causality in a case report, it is logical to think that a beta-agonist like salbutamol (known to induce tachycardia) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta-blocker such as atenolol (that blocks the adrenergic activity) may relieve it.",1,0,1,0

"Effect of lindane on hepatic and brain cytochrome P450s and influence of P450 modulation in lindane induced neurotoxicity. Oral administration of lindane (2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg/kg, body weight) for 5 days was found to produce a dose-dependent increase in the activity of P450 dependent 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-dealkylase (PROD) and N-nitrosodimethylamine demethylase (NDMA-d) in rat brain and liver. A significant increase in the hepatic and brain P450 monooxygenases was also observed when the duration of exposure of low dose (2.5 mg/kg) of lindane was increased from 5 days to 15 or 21 days. As observed with different doses, the magnitude of induction in the activity of P450 monooxygenases was several fold higher in liver microsomes when compared with the brain. Western blotting studies have indicated that the increase in the P450 enzymes could be due to the increase in the expression of P450 1A1/1A2, 2B1/2B2 and 2E1 isoenzymes. In vitro studies using organic inhibitors specific for individual P450 isoenzymes and antibody inhibition experiments have further demonstrated that the increase in the activity of PROD, EROD and NDMA-d are due to the increase in the levels of P450 2B1/2B2, 1A1/1A2 and 2E1 isoenzymes, respectively. Induction studies have further shown that while pretreatment of 3-methylcholanthrene (MC), an inducer of P4501A1/1A2, did not produce any significant effect in the incidence of lindane induced convulsions, pretreatment with phenobarbital (PB), an inducer of P450 2B1/2B2 or ethanol, an inducer of P450 2E1 catalysed reactions, significantly increased the incidence of lindane induced convulsions. Similarly, when the P450-mediated metabolism of lindane was blocked by cobalt chloride incidence of convulsions was increased in animals treated with lindane indicating that lindane per se or its metabolites formed by PB or ethanol inducible P450 isoenzymes are involved in its neurobehavioral toxicity.",0,1,1,0

"The Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy protein, emerin, is a nuclear membrane protein. A large fragment of emerin cDNA was prepared by PCR and expressed as a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli .

All the mAbs recognised a 34 kDa protein in all tissues tested , though minor emerin-related bands were also detected in some tissues . Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that emerin is located at the nuclear rim in all tissues examined . A muscle biopsy from an Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy ( EMDM ) patient showed complete absence of emerin by both Western blotting and immunohistochemistry , suggesting a simple diagnostic antibody test for EDMD families .

"Simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation. Abstract Serum aminotransferase elevations are a commonly known adverse effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy. However, hepatotoxic events have not been widely published with ezetimibe or the combination agent simvastatin-ezetimibe. We describe a 70-year-old Hispanic woman who developed fulminant hepatic failure necessitating liver transplantation 10 weeks after conversion from simvastatin 40 mg/day to simvastatin 10 mg-ezetimibe 40 mg/day. The patient's lipid panel had been maintained with simvastatin for 18 months before the conversion without evidence of hepatotoxicity. A routine laboratory work-up 10 weeks after conversion revealed elevated serum aminotransferase levels. Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram (which she was taking for depression) were discontinued, and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded. A repeat work-up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels, and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate-to-severe drug toxicity. She underwent liver transplantation with an uneventful postoperative course. Her aminotransferase levels returned to normal by postoperative day 23, and her 2-year follow-up showed no adverse events. Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases (UGT) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid, resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of simvastatin-ezetimibe-induced liver failure that resulted in liver transplantation. We postulate that the mechanism of the simvastatinezetimibe-induced hepatotoxicity is the increased simvastatin exposure by ezetimibe inhibition of UGT enzymes. Clinicians should be aware of potential hepatotoxicity with simvastatin-ezetimibe especially in elderly patients and should carefully monitor serum aminotransferase levels when starting therapy and titrating the dosage.",0,1,0,0

"Mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with aminonucleoside nephrosis. The possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) model. Five male Wistar rats received repeated subcutaneous PAN injections; five controls received saline only. After 4 weeks the PAN rats were severely proteinuric (190 +/- 80 mg/24 hr), and all rats were given colloidal carbon (CC) intravenously. At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 +/- 3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats; glomeruli of the controls were normal. Glomeruli of PAN rats contained significantly more CC than glomeruli of controls. Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non-sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys. CC was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomeruli. Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment, we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently. Cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the PAN glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this model. Similar to the remnant kidney model in PAN nephrosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to ""mesangial overloading.""",0,1,0,0

"Standard operating procedures for antibiotic therapy and the occurrence of acute kidney injury: a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. INTRODUCTION: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 7% of hospitalized and 66% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. It increases mortality, hospital length of stay, and costs. The aim of this study was to investigate, whether there is an association between adherence to guidelines (standard operating procedures (SOP)) for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics and the occurrence of AKI. METHODS: This study was carried out as a prospective, clinical, non-interventional, observational study. Data collection was performed over a total of 170 days in three ICUs at Charite - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin. A total of 675 patients were included; 163 of these had therapy with vancomycin, gentamicin, or tobramycin; were >18 years; and treated in the ICU for >24 hours. Patients with an adherence to SOP >70% were classified into the high adherence group (HAG) and patients with an adherence of <70% into the low adherence group (LAG). AKI was defined according to RIFLE criteria. Adherence to SOPs was evaluated by retrospective expert audit. Development of AKI was compared between groups with exact Chi2-test and multivariate logistic regression analysis (two-sided P <0.05). RESULTS: LAG consisted of 75 patients (46%) versus 88 HAG patients (54%). AKI occurred significantly more often in LAG with 36% versus 21% in HAG (P = 0.035). Basic characteristics were comparable, except an increased rate of soft tissue infections in LAG. Multivariate analysis revealed an odds ratio of 2.5-fold for LAG to develop AKI compared with HAG (95% confidence interval 1.195 to 5.124, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION: Low adherence to SOPs for potentially nephrotoxic antibiotics was associated with a higher occurrence of AKI. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN54598675.

"Comparison of the effectiveness of ranitidine and cimetidine in inhibiting acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. The H2-histamine receptor antagonists ranitidine and cimetidine were compared for their abilities to control gastric acid hypersecretion on a short- and long-term basis in 22 patients with gastric acid hypersecretory states. Nineteen patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, one patient had systemic mastocytosis, and two patients had idiopathic hypersecretion. The rates of onset of the action of cimetidine and ranitidine were the same. The actions of both drugs were increased by anticholinergic agents, and there was a close correlation between the daily maintenance dose of each drug needed to control acid secretion. However, ranitidine was threefold more potent than cimetidine both in acute inhibition studies and in the median maintenance dose needed (1.2 g per day for ranitidine and 3.6 g per day for cimetidine). Sixty percent of the males developed breast changes or impotence while taking cimetidine and in all cases these changes disappeared when cimetidine was replaced by ranitidine. Treatment with high doses of cimetidine (one to 60 months; median, 11 months) or ranitidine (two to 31 months; median, 14 months) was not associated with hepatic or hematologic toxicity or alterations of serum gastrin concentrations, but ranitidine therapy was associated with a significantly lower serum creatinine level than seen with cimetidine therapy. The results show that both drugs can adequately inhibit acid secretion in patients with gastric hypersecretory states. Both are safe at high doses, but ranitidine is threefold more potent and does not cause the antiandrogen side effects frequently seen with high doses of cimetidine.",0,1,0,0
"Effects of cromakalim and pinacidil on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dogs. The effects of i.v. bolus administration of cromakalim (1-10 micrograms/kg) and pinacidil (3-100 micrograms/kg) on large (circumflex artery) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin (0.03-10 micrograms/kg). Nitroglycerin, up to 0.3 micrograms/kg, selectively increased circumflex artery diameter (CxAD) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter. In contrast, cromakalim and pinacidil at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms/kg simultaneously and dose-dependently increased CxAD, coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pressure. Cromakalim was approximately 8- to 9.5-fold more potent than pinacidil in increasing CxAD. Vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cromakalim and pinacidil were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug-induced tachycardia was abolished. When circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant, the increases in CxAD induced by cromakalim (10 micrograms/kg), pinacidil (30 micrograms/kg) and nitroglycerin (10 micrograms/kg) were reduced by 68 +/- 7, 54 +/- 9 and 1 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus, whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow-independently dilates large coronary arteries, cromakalim and pinacidil dilate both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors-mediated rise in myocardial metabolic demand. Finally, two mechanisms at least, direct vasodilation and flow dependency, are involved in the cromakalim- and pinacidil-induced increase in CxAD.",1,0,1,0

"Arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy: a complication associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therapy.

The clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin, and might serve to warn the clinician of these complications. Previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are reviewed.

"Treatment of Crohn's disease with fusidic acid: an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T-cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin. Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn's disease, a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active, therapy-resistant patients. Eight Crohn's disease patients were included. Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 weeks. The disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading score. Five of 8 patients (63%) improved during fusidic acid treatment: 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks. There were no serious clinical side effects, but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea. Biochemically, an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases (63%), and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treatment. All reversed to pre-treatment levels after cessation of treatment. The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective. Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease, we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated.",0,0,1,0

"A phase I study of 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin. Clinical pharmacology and pharmacokinetics. A Phase I study of intravenous (IV) bolus 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycin (Pirarubicin) was done in 55 patients in good performance status with refractory tumors. Twenty-six had minimal prior therapy (good risk), 23 had extensive prior therapy (poor risk), and six had renal and/or hepatic dysfunction. A total of 167 courses at doses of 15 to 70 mg/m2 were evaluable. Maximum tolerated dose in good-risk patients was 70 mg/m2, and in poor-risk patients, 60 mg/m2. The dose-limiting toxic effect was transient noncumulative granulocytopenia. Granulocyte nadir was on day 14 (range, 4-22). Less frequent toxic effects included thrombocytopenia, anemia, nausea, mild alopecia, phlebitis, and mucositis. Myelosuppression was more in patients with hepatic dysfunction. Pharmacokinetic analyses in 21 patients revealed Pirarubicin plasma T 1/2 alpha (+/- SE) of 2.5 +/- 0.85 minutes, T beta 1/2 of 25.6 +/- 6.5 minutes, and T 1/2 gamma of 23.6 +/- 7.6 hours.

"Acute hepatitis attack after exposure to telithromycin. INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic-associated hepatotoxicity is rare. With widespread use of antimicrobial agents, however, hepatic injury occurs frequently, and among adverse drug reactions, idiosyncratic reactions are the most serious. CASE SUMMARY: A 25-year-old male patient, with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to Marmara University Hospital Emergency Department, Istanbul, Turkey, with 5 days' history of jaundice, malaise, nausea, and vomiting. He had been prescribed telithromycin 400 mg/d PO to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days prior. Admission laboratory tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase, 67 U/L (reference range, 10-37 U/L); aspartate aminotransferase, 98 U/L (10-40 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 513 U/L (0-270 U/L); gamma-glutamyltransferase, 32 U/L (7-49 U/L); amylase, 46 U/L (0-220 U/L); total bilirubin, 20.1 mg/dL (0.2-1.0 mg/dL); direct bilirubin, 14.8 mg/dL (0-0.3 mg/dL); and albumin, 4.7 mg/dL (3.5-5.4 mg/dL). No toxin, alcohol, or other drugs were reported. The patient had suffered a previous episode of ""acute hepatitis of unknown origin,"" that occurred after telithromycin usage. Both incidents occurred within a year. DISCUSSION: Telithromycin is the first of the ketolide antibacterials to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval for clinical use. It has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dysfunction. Based on a score of 8 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale, telithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient, and pathological findings suggested drug-induced toxic hepatitis. Recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed telithromycin the second time. CONCLUSION: Here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of telithromycin.",0,1,0,0

"Sodium status influences chronic amphotericin B nephrotoxicity in rats. The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B (5 mg/kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks) has been investigated in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats. In salt-depleted rats, amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time, with an 85% reduction by week 3. In contrast, in normal-salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3, and in salt-loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3. All rats in the sodium-depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal-salt or salt-loaded rat. Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study. However, at the end of 3 weeks, amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt-depleted and normal-salt rats than those in salt-loaded rats, with plasma/kidney ratios of 21, 14, and 8 in salt-depleted, normal-salt, and salt-loaded rats, respectively. In conclusion, reductions in creatinine clearance and renal amphotericin B accumulation after chronic amphotericin B administration were enhanced by salt depletion and attenuated by sodium loading in rats.",0,1,0,0

"Fabry disease: identification of novel alpha-galactosidase A mutations and molecular carrier detection by use of fluorescent chemical cleavage of mismatches. Fabry disease ( FD ) ( angiokeratoma corporis diffusum ) is an X-linked inborn error of glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by defects in the lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A gene ( GLA ) . The enzymatic defect leads to the systemic accumulation of neutral glycosphingolipids with terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties . Clinically , affected hemizygous males have angiokeratoma , severe acroparesthesia , renal failure , and vasculopathy of the heart and brain . While demonstration of alpha-galactosidase deficiency in leukocytes is diagnostic in affected males , enzymatic detection of female carriers is often inconclusive , due to random X-chromosomal inactivation , underlining the need of molecular investigations for accurate genetic counseling . By use of chemical cleavage of mismatches adapted to fluorescence-based detection systems , we have characterized the mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency in 16 individuals from six unrelated families with FD .

"Screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patients. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patients. METHODS: This prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evaluation. Plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine using enzyme-mediated immunoassay methodology. Plasma samples with benzoylecgonine greater than 150 ng/mL or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng/mL were defined as positive. Patient demographics, history of underlying drug or alcohol-related seizure disorder, estimated time from seizure to sample collection, history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse, results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse, and assay results were recorded without patient identifiers. RESULTS: Fourteen of 248 (5.6%, 95% CI 2.7%-8.5%) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoylecgonine and no samples (0%, 95% CI 0-1.2%) were positive for amphetamine. Positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse (p < 0.0005).

"Clinical safety of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated myocardial infarction. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-induced myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: A retrospective, multicenter study. SETTING: Twenty-nine university, university-affiliated, or community hospitals during a 6-year period (total of 117 cumulative hospital-years). PARTICIPANTS: Patients with cocaine-associated MI who received lidocaine in the emergency department. RESULTS: Of 29 patients who received lidocaine in the setting of cocaine-associated MI, no patient died; exhibited bradydysrhythmias, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation; or experienced seizures after administration of lidocaine (95% confidence interval, 0% to 11%). CONCLUSION: Despite theoretical concerns that lidocaine may enhance cocaine toxicity, the use of lidocaine in patients with cocaine-associated MI was not associated with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system toxicity.",1,0,1,0
"Cholestatic jaundice associated with the use of metformin. We report a patient who developed cholestatic jaundice shortly after initiation of treatment with metformin hydrochloride. Ultrasound of the liver and abdominal CT were normal. An ERCP showed normal biliary anatomy. A percutaneous liver biopsy was obtained showing marked cholestasis, with portal edema, ductular proliferation, and acute inflammation. Metformin hydrochloride was discontinued, and the patient's jaundice resolved slowly over a period of several months. Given the onset of his jaundice 2 wk after the initiation of metformin, we believe that this case represents an example of metformin-associated hepatotoxicity, the first such case reported.",0,1,0,0

"Incidence of postoperative delirium is high even in a population without known risk factors. PURPOSE: Postoperative delirium is a recognized complication in populations at risk. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of early postoperative delirium in a population without known risk factors admitted to the ICU for postoperative monitoring after elective major surgery. The secondary outcome investigated is to identify eventual independent risk factors among demographic data and anesthetic drugs used. METHODS: An observational, prospective study was conducted on a consecutive cohort of patients admitted to our ICU within and for at least 24 h after major surgical procedures. Exclusion criteria were any preexisting predisposing factor for delirium or other potentially confounding neurological dysfunctions. Patients were assessed daily using the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale for 3 days after the surgical procedure. Early postoperative delirium incidence risk factors were then assessed through three different multiple regression models. RESULTS: According to the confusion assessment method for the ICU scale, 28 % of patients were diagnosed with early postoperative delirium. The use of thiopentone was significantly associated with an eight-fold-higher risk for delirium compared to propofol (57.1% vs. 7.1%, RR = 8.0, X2 = 4.256; df = 1; 0.05 < p < 0.02). CONCLUSION: In this study early postoperative delirium was found to be a very common complication after major surgery, even in a population without known risk factors.

"Microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine-induced amnesia in adult male rats. The effect of ritanserin (5-HT2 antagonist) on scopolamine (muscarinic cholinergic antagonist)-induced amnesia in Morris water maze (MWM) was investigated. Rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into CA1 region of the hippocampus. One week later, they received repeatedly vehicles (saline, DMSO, saline+DMSO), scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl saline/side; 30 min before training), ritanserin (2, 4 and 8 microg/0.5 microl DMSO/side; 20 min before training) and scopolamine (2 microg/0.5 microl; 30 min before ritanserin injection)+ritanserin (4 microg/0.5 microl DMSO) through cannulae each day. Animals were tested for four consecutive days (4 trial/day) in MWM during which the position of hidden platform was unchanged. In the fifth day, the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor, motivational and visual systems. The results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and traveled distances to find platform in scopolamine-treated group as compared to saline group. Ritanserin-treated rats (4 microg/0.5 microl/side) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to DMSO-treated group. However, scopolamine and ritanserin co-administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and traveled distances as compared to the scopolamine-treated rats. Our findings show that microinjection of ritanserin into the CA1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine-induced amnesia.",0,0,1,0
"Protective effect of a specific platelet-activating factor antagonist, BN 52021, on bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular impairments in rats. Administration of the local anaesthetic bupivacaine (1.5 or 2 mg/kg, i.v.) to rats elicited a marked decrease of mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) leading to death (in 67% or 90% of animals respectively). Intravenous injection of the specific platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist BN 52021 (10 mg/kg), 30 min before bupivacaine administration (2 mg/kg i.v.) suppressed both the decrease of MBP and HR. In contrast, doses of 1 mg/kg BN 52021 given 30 min before or 10 mg/kg administered 5 min before i.v. injection of bupivacaine were ineffective. When BN 52021 (20 mg/kg i.v.) was injected immediately after bupivacaine (2 mg/kg), a partial reversion of the decrease of MBP and HR was observed, whereas the dose of 10 mg/kg was ineffective. A partial recovery of bupivacaine-induced ECG alterations was observed after pretreatment of the rats with BN 52021. Since the administration of BN 52021, at all doses studied, did not alter MBP and HR at the doses used, the bulk of these results clearly demonstrate a protective action of BN 52021, a specific antagonist of PAF, against bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular toxicity. Thus, consistent with its direct effect on heart, PAF appears to be implicated in bupivacaine-induced cardiovascular alterations.",1,0,0,0

"Iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant yeast frataxin: implications for Friedreich ataxia. Frataxin deficiency is the primary cause of Friedreich ataxia ( FRDA ) , an autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative and neurodegenerative disease . Frataxin is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein that is widely conserved among eukaryotes . Genetic inactivation of the yeast frataxin homologue ( Yfh1p ) results in mitochondrial iron accumulation and hypersensitivity to oxidative stress . Increased iron deposition and evidence of oxidative damage have also been observed in cardiac tissue and cultured fibroblasts from patients with FRDA . These findings indicate that frataxin is essential for mitochondrial iron homeostasis and protection from iron-induced formation of free radicals . The functional mechanism of frataxin , however , is still unknown . We have expressed the mature form of Yfh1p ( mYfh1p ) in Escherichia coli and have analyzed its function in vitro . Isolated mYfh1p is a soluble monomer ( 13 , 783 Da ) that contains no iron and shows no significant tendency to self-associate . Aerobic addition of ferrous iron to mYfh1p results in assembly of regular spherical multimers with a molecular mass of approximately 1 . 1 MDa ( megadaltons ) and a diameter of 13 + / -2 nm . Each multimer consists of approximately 60 subunits and can sequester > 3 , 000 atoms of iron . Titration of mYfh1p with increasing iron concentrations supports a stepwise mechanism of multimer assembly . Sequential addition of an iron chelator and a reducing agent results in quantitative iron release with concomitant disassembly of the multimer , indicating that mYfh1p sequesters iron in an available form . In yeast mitochondria , native mYfh1p exists as monomer and a higher-order species with a molecular weight > 600 , 000 . After addition of ( 55 ) Fe to the medium , immunoprecipitates of this species contain > 16 atoms of ( 55 ) Fe per molecule of mYfh1p . We propose that iron-dependent self-assembly of recombinant mYfh1p reflects a physiological role for frataxin in mitochondrial iron sequestration and bioavailability . .",1,0,1,0

"Protection against amphetamine-induced neurotoxicity toward striatal dopamine neurons in rodents by LY274614, an excitatory amino acid antagonist. LY274614, 3SR,4aRS,6SR,8aRS-6-[phosphonomethyl]decahydr oisoquinoline-3- carboxylic acid, has been described as a potent antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor. Here its ability to antagonize the prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum by amphetamine in iprindole-treated rats is reported. A single 18.4 mg/kg (i.p.) dose of (+/-)-amphetamine hemisulfate, given to rats pretreated with iprindole, resulted in persistent depletion of dopamine in the striatum 1 week later. This prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum was antagonized by dizocilpine (MK-801, a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors) or by LY274614 (a competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors). The protective effect of LY274614 was dose-dependent, being maximum at 10-40 mgkg (i.p.). A 10 mg/kg dose of LY274614 was effective in antagonizing the depletion of dopamine in the striatum, when given as long as 8 hr prior to amphetamine but not when given 24 hr prior to amphetamine. Depletion of dopamine in the striatum was also antagonized when LY274614 was given after the injection of amphetamine; LY274614 protected when given up to 4 hr after but not when given 8 or 24 hr after amphetamine. The prolonged depletion of dopamine in the striatum in mice, given multiple injections of methamphetamine, was also antagonized dose-dependently and completely by LY274614. The data strengthen the evidence that the neurotoxic effect of amphetamine and related compounds toward nigrostriatal dopamine neurons involves NMDA receptors and that LY274614 is an NMDA receptor antagonist with long-lasting in vivo effects in rats.",0,0,1,0

"Central nervous system toxicity following the administration of levobupivacaine for lumbar plexus block: A report of two cases. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesia. Levobupivacaine, the pure S(-) enantiomer of bupivacaine, was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bupivacaine. We describe 2 cases of grand mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of levobupivacaine. CASE REPORT: Two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior approach. Immediately after the administration of levobupivacaine 0.5% with epinephrine 2.5 microgram/mL, the patients developed grand mal seizures, despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administration. The seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succinylcholine in 1 patient. Neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxicity. Both patients were treated preoperatively with beta-adrenergic antagonist medications, which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of levobupivacaine with epinephrine. CONCLUSIONS: Although levobupivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine, if adequate amounts of levobupivacaine reach the circulation, it will result in convulsions. Plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients.",1,0,1,0

"Effects of the antidepressant trazodone, a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist, on dopamine-dependent behaviors in rats. RATIONALE: 5-Hydroxytryptamine, via stimulation of 5-HT 2C receptors, exerts a tonic inhibitory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas activation of 5-HT 2A receptors enhances stimulated DAergic neurotransmission. The antidepressant trazodone is a 5-HT 2A/2C receptor antagonist. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system. METHODS: The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine-induced oral stereotypies, on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), on ergometrine-induced wet dog shake (WDS) behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections was studied in rats. We also investigated whether trazodone induces catalepsy in rats. RESULTS: Trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg i.p. did not induce catalepsy, and did not antagonize apomorphine (1.5 and 3 mg/kg) stereotypy and apomorphine (0.05 mg/kg)-induced catalepsy. However, pretreatment with 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg i.p. trazodone enhanced dexamphetamine stereotypy, and antagonized haloperidol catalepsy, ergometrine-induced WDS behavior and fluoxetine-induced penile erections. Trazodone at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg i.p. induced catalepsy and antagonized apomorphine and dexamphetamine stereotypies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5-20 mg/kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors, while at 30, 40 and 50 mg/kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors. Furthermore, at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, trazodone blocks 5-HT 2A and 5-HT 2C receptors. We suggest that trazodone (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg), by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors, releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT, and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy.",0,0,1,0

"Effects of deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function. The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value.

"hCds1-mediated phosphorylation of BRCA1 regulates the DNA damage response. Mutations in the BRCA1 ( ref . 1 ) tumour suppressor gene are found in almost all of the families with inherited breast and ovarian cancers and about half of the families with only breast cancer . Although the biochemical function of BRCA1 is not well understood , it is important for DNA damage repair and cell-cycle checkpoint . BRCA1 exists in nuclear foci but is hyperphosphorylated and disperses after DNA damage . It is not known whether BRCA1 phosphorylation and dispersion and its function in DNA damage response are related . In yeast the DNA damage response and the replication-block checkpoint are mediated partly through the Cds1 kinase family . Here we report that the human Cds1 kinase ( hCds1 / Chk2 ) regulates BRCA1 function after DNA damage by phosphorylating serine 988 of BRCA1 . We show that hCds1 and BRCA1 interact and co-localize within discrete nuclear foci but separate after gamma irradiation . Phosphorylation of BRCA1 at serine 988 is required for the release of BRCA1 from hCds1 . This phosphorylation is also important for the ability of BRCA1 to restore survival after DNA damage in the BRCA1-mutated cell line HCC1937 . .",0,0,0,1
"Germline E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations predispose to familial gastric cancer and colorectal cancer . Inherited mutations in the E-cadherin gene ( CDH1 ) were described recently in three Maori kindreds with familial gastric cancer . Familial gastric cancer is genetically heterogeneous and it is not clear what proportion of gastric cancer susceptibility in non-Maori populations is due to germline CDH1 mutations . Therefore , we screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds of British and Irish origin for germline CDH1 mutations , by SSCP analysis of all 16 exons and flanking sequences . Each family contained  ( i ) two cases of gastric cancer in first degree relatives with one affected before age 50 years ; or ( ii ) three or more cases of gastric cancer . Novel germline CDH1 mutations ( a nonsense and a splice site ) were detected in two families ( 25 % ) . Both mutations were predicted to truncate the E-cadherin protein in the signal peptide domain . In one family there was evidence of non-penetrance and susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancer ; thus , in addition to six cases of gastric cancer , a CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer at age 30 years . We have confirmed that germline mutations in the CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer in non-Maori populations . However , only a minority of familial gastric cancers can be accounted for by CDH1 mutations . Loss of E-cadherin function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal and other cancers , and our findings provide evidence that germline CDH1 mutations predispose to early onset colorectal cancer . Thus , CDH1 should be investigated as a cause of inherited susceptibility to both gastric and colorectal cancers .",0,0,0,1
"Long-term lithium treatment and the kidney. Interim report on fifty patients. This is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long-term lithium treatment on the kidney. Creatinine clearance, maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 affectively ill patients who have been on long-term lithium for more than one year. These findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium, available for most of our patients. No evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treatment. Low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre-lithium values. Urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patients. The concentration defect appeared reversible, at least in part. Polyuria above 3 litres/24 hours was found in 10% of patients.

"Comparison of developmental toxicology of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) in rats using selected dosing paradigms. BACKGROUND: Analysis of the literature for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suggests that a low incidence of developmental anomalies occurs in rats given NSAIDs on specific days during organogenesis. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]), an irreversible cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 inhibitor, induces developmental anomalies when administered to Wistar rats on gestational day (GD) 9, 10, or 11 (Kimmel CA, Wilson JG, Schumacher HJ. Teratology 4:15-24, 1971). There are no published ASA studies using the multiple dosing paradigm of GDs 6 to 17. Objectives of the current study were to compare results between Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Wistar strains when ASA is administered on GD 9, 10, or 11; to compare the malformation patterns following single and multiple dosings during organogenesis in SD rats; and to test the hypothesis that maternal gastrointestinal toxicity confounds the detection of low incidence malformations with ASA when a multiple dosing paradigm is used. METHODS: ASA was administered as a single dose on GD 9 (0, 250, 500, or 625 mg/kg), 10 (0, 500, 625, or 750 mg/kg), or 11 (0, 500, 750, or 1000 mg/kg) and from GD 6 to GD 17 (0, 50, 125, or 250 mg/kg a day) in the multiple dose study to SD rats. Animals were killed on GD 21, and fetuses were examined viscerally. RESULTS: The literature evaluation suggested that NSAIDs induce ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and midline defects (MDs) in rats and diaphragmatic hernia (DH), MDs, and VSDs in rabbits (Cook JC et al., 2003); hence, the present study focused on these malformations, even though ASA induces several other low-incidence malformations. In single dose studies, DH, MD, and VSD were induced on GDs 9 and 10. VSD also was noted following treatment on GD 11. In contrast, DH and MD were noted in the multiple dose study design only in the high-dose group, and VSD was noted across all dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: High concordance in major developmental anomalies between Wistar and SD rats were noted with the exception of VSD in the SD rats and hydrocephalus in the Wistar rats. Variations and malformations were similar when ASA was administered as a single dose or during the period of organogenesis (GDs 6 to 17). It was also evident that, by titrating the dose to achieve a maximum tolerated dose, malformations that normally occur at low incidence, as reported from previous single dose studies, could also be induced with ASA given at multiple doses.",0,0,1,0
"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome induced by combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride in a Japanese patient with Huntington's disease at the terminal stage of recurrent breast cancer. We herein describe the case of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with neuroleptic malignant syndrome that occurred 36 days after the initiation of combination therapy with tiapride (75 mg/day) and tetrabenazine (12.5 mg/day) for Huntington's disease. The patient had been treated with tiapride or tetrabenazine alone without any adverse effects before the administration of the combination therapy. She also had advanced breast cancer when the combination therapy was initiated. To the best of our knowledge, the occurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to combination therapy with tetrabenazine and tiapride has not been previously reported. Tetrabenazine should be administered very carefully in combination with other neuroleptic drugs, particularly in patients with a worsening general condition.",0,0,1,1
"Calcium carbonate toxicity: the updated milk-alkali syndrome; report of 3 cases and review of the literature. OBJECTIVE: To describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate-induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk-alkali syndrome. METHODS: We report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia (corrected serum calcium > or = 14 mg/dL) and review the pertinent literature on milk-alkali syndrome. RESULTS: The 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency, relative metabolic alkalosis, and low parathyroid hormone (PTH), PTH-related peptide, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations. No malignant lesion was found. Treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furosemide. The 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received pamidronate intravenously (60 and 30 mg, respectively), which caused severe hypocalcemia. Of the 3 patients, 2 were ingesting acceptable doses of elemental calcium (1 g and 2 g daily, respectively) in the form of calcium carbonate. In addition to our highlighted cases, we review the history, classification, pathophysiologic features, and treatment of milk-alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to November 2003. CONCLUSION: Milk-alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible persons. Treatment with hydration, furosemide, and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin D source is adequate. Pamidronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia, even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia.",0,1,0,0
"Effect of green tea and vitamin E combination in isoproterenol induced myocardial infarction in rats. The present study was aimed to investigate the combined effects of green tea and vitamin E on heart weight, body weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidants and membrane bound ATPases in isoproterenol (ISO)-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Adult male albino rats, treated with ISO (200 mg/kg, s.c.) for 2 days at an interval of 24 h caused a significant (P<0.05) elevation of heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation and Ca+2 ATPase level whereas there was a significant (P<0.05) decrease in body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/ K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase levels. Administration of green tea (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) and vitamin E (100 mg/kg/day, p.o.) together for 30 consecutive days and challenged with ISO on the day 29th and 30th, showed a significant (P<0.05) decrease in heart weight, serum marker enzymes, lipid peroxidation, Ca+2 ATPase and a significant increase in the body weight, endogenous antioxidants, Na+/K+ ATPase and Mg+2 ATPase when compared with ISO treated group and green tea or vitamin E alone treated groups. These findings indicate the synergistic protective effect of green tea and vitamin E during ISO induced myocardial infarction in rats.",1,0,0,0

"Expression and imprinting of MAGEL2 suggest a role in Prader-willi syndrome and the homologous murine imprinting phenotype. Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) is caused by the loss of expression of imprinted genes in chromosome 15q11-q13 . Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia , developmental delay and childhood-onset obesity . Necdin , a protein implicated in the terminal differentiation of neurons , is the only PWS candidate gene to reduce viability when disrupted in a mouse model . In this study , we have characterized MAGEL2 ( also known as NDNL1 ) , a gene with 51 % amino acid sequence similarity to necdin and located 41 kb distal to NDN in the PWS deletion region . MAGEL2 is expressed predominantly in brain , the primary tissue affected in PWS and in several fetal tissues as shown by northern blot analysis . MAGEL2 is imprinted with monoallelic expression in control brain , and paternal-only expression in the central nervous system as demonstrated by its lack of expression in brain from a PWS-affected individual . The orthologous mouse gene ( Magel2 ) is located within 150 kb of NDN  , is imprinted with paternal-only expression and is expressed predominantly in late developmental stages and adult brain as shown by northern blotting , RT-PCR and whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization . Magel2 distribution partially overlaps that of NDN  , with strong expression being detected in the central nervous system in mid-gestation mouse embryos by in situ hybridization . We hypothesize that , although loss of necdin expression may be important in the neonatal presentation of PWS , loss of MAGEL2 may be critical to abnormalities in brain development and dysmorphic features in individuals with PWS . .",0,0,1,0
"Fas preassociation required for apoptosis signaling and dominant inhibition by pathogenic mutations. Heterozygous mutations encoding abnormal forms of the death receptor Fas dominantly interfere with Fas-induced lymphocyte apoptosis in human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome . This effect , rather than depending on ligand-induced receptor oligomerization , was found to stem from ligand- independent interaction of wild-type and mutant Fas receptors through a specific region in the extracellular domain . Preassociated Fas complexes were found in living cells by means of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between variants of green fluorescent protein .

"Influence of PAX6 gene dosage on development: overexpression causes severe eye abnormalities. Aniridia in man and Small eye in mice are semidominant developmental disorders caused by mutations within the paired box gene PAX6 . Whereas heterozygotes suffer from iris hypoplasia , homozygous mice lack eyes and nasal cavities and exhibit brain abnormalities . To investigate the role of gene dosage in more detail , we have generated yeast artificial chromosome transgenic mice carrying the human PAX6 locus . When crossed onto the Small eye background , the transgene rescues the mutant phenotype . Strikingly , mice carrying multiple copies on a wild-type background show specific developmental abnormalities of the eye , but not of other tissues expressing the gene . Thus , at least five different eye phenotypes are associated with changes in PAX6 expression . We provide evidence that not only reduced , but also increased levels of transcriptional regulators can cause developmental defects . .",0,0,1,0

"Fetal risks due to warfarin therapy during pregnancy. Two mothers with heart valve prosthesis were treated with warfarin during pregnancy. In the first case a caesarean section was done one week after replacement of warfarin with heparin. The baby died of cerebral and pulmonary hemorrhage. The second mother had a male infant by caesarean section. The baby showed warfarin-induced embryopathy with nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses (chondrodysplasia punctata). Nasal hypoplasia with or without stippled epiphyses has now been reported in 11 infants born to mothers treated with warfarin during the first trimester, and a causal association is probable. In view of the risks to both mother and fetus in women with prosthetic cardiac valves it is recommended that therapeutic abortion be advised as the first alternative.",1,0,0,0
"Comparative cognitive and subjective side effects of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy middle-aged and older adults. This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone in healthy, older (> 65 years), and middle-aged (35 to 55 years) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain. Seventy-one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition (placebo, 10-mg oxycodone). Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose (P < .01) and pupil size, an indication of physiological effects of the medication, peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose (P < .01). Significant declines in simple and sustained attention, working memory, and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose. For almost all cognitive measures, there were no medication by age-interaction effects, which indicates that the 2 age groups exhibited similar responses to the medication challenge. This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain, neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate-release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle-aged adults. PERSPECTIVE: Study findings indicate that the metabolism, neurocognitive effects, and physical side effects of oral oxycodone are similar for healthy middle-aged and older adults. Therefore, clinicians should not avoid prescribing oral opioids to older adults based on the belief that older adults are at higher risk for side effects than younger adults.",0,0,1,0

"Absence of disease phenotype and intergenerational stability of the CAG repeat in transgenic mice expressing the human Huntington disease transcript. The mutation underlying Huntington disease ( HD ) is CAG expansion in the first exon of the HD gene . In order to investigate the role of CAG expansion in the pathogenesis of HD , we have produced transgenic mice containing the full length human HD cDNA with 44 CAG repeats . By 1 year , these mice have no behavioral abnormalities and morphometric analysis at 6 ( one animal ) and 9 ( two animals ) months age revealed no changes . Despite high levels of mRNA expression , there was no evidence of the HD gene product in any of these transgenic mice . In vitro transfection studies indicated that the inclusion of 120 bp of the 5 UTR in the cDNA construct and the presence of a frameshift mutation at nucleotide 2349 prevented expression of the HD cDNA . These findings suggest that the pathogenesis of HD is not mediated through DNA-protein interaction and that presence of the RNA transcript with an expanded CAG repeat is insufficient to cause the disease . Rather , translation of the CAG is crucial for the pathogenesis of HD . In contrast to that seen in humans , the CAG repeat in these mice was remarkably stable in 97 meioses . This suggests that genomic sequences may play a critical role in influencing repeat instability . .",0,0,1,0

"Glycerol as a correlate of impaired glucose tolerance: dissection of a complex system by use of a simple genetic trait.

The relationship between glycerol and the risk of IGT , however , is poorly understood . We therefore undertook the study of fasting plasma glycerol levels in a cohort of 1 , 056 unrelated men and women of French-Canadian descent .

"Induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administration. We documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high supraglottic resistance while awake in a 54-yr-old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgens. When the androgens were withdrawn, the patient's physical changes, symptoms, sleep study, and supraglottic resistance all returned to normal. A rechallenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that abated upon withdrawal of the hormone. Previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Our report provides direct evidence for this role. Structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sleep. Development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy.",0,0,1,0
"Organophosphate-induced convulsions and prevention of neuropathological damages. Such organophosphorus (OP) compounds as diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), sarin and soman are potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) and butyrylcholinesterases (BChEs). The acute toxicity of OPs is the result of their irreversible binding with AChEs in the central nervous system (CNS), which elevates acetylcholine (ACh) levels. The protective action of subcutaneously (SC) administered antidotes or their combinations in DFP (2.0 mg/kg BW) intoxication was studied in 9-10-weeks-old Han-Wistar male rats. The rats received AChE reactivator pralidoxime-2-chloride (2PAM) (30.0 mg/kg BW), anticonvulsant diazepam (2.0 mg/kg BW), A(1)-adenosine receptor agonist N(6)-cyclopentyl adenosine (CPA) (2.0 mg/kg BW), NMDA-receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (+-MK801 hydrogen maleate) (2.0 mg/kg BW) or their combinations with cholinolytic drug atropine sulfate (50.0 mg/kg BW) immediately or 30 min after the single SC injection of DFP. The control rats received atropine sulfate, but also saline and olive oil instead of other antidotes and DFP, respectively. All rats were terminated either 24 h or 3 weeks after the DFP injection. The rats treated with DFP-atropine showed severe typical OP-induced toxicity signs. When CPA, diazepam or 2PAM was given immediately after DFP-atropine, these treatments prevented, delayed or shortened the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning. Atropine-MK801 did not offer any additional protection against DFP toxicity. In conclusion, CPA, diazepam and 2PAM in combination with atropine prevented the occurrence of serious signs of poisoning and thus reduced the toxicity of DFP in rat.",0,0,1,0

"The epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from suprofen. Suprofen, a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic agent. Until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system, 700,000 persons used the drug in the United States. Through August 1986, a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were reported. To elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome, a case-control study was performed, comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 suprofen-exposed control subjects who did not have the syndrome. Case patients were more likely to be men (odds ratio, 3.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-12.1), suffer from hay fever and asthma (odds ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-11.9); to participate in regular exercise (odds ratio, 5.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-30.7), especially in the use of Nautilus equipment (p = 0.02); and to use alcohol (odds ratio, 4.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-17.5). Possible risk factors included young age, concurrent use of other analgesic agents (especially ibuprofen), preexisting renal disease, a history of kidney stones, a history of gout, a recent increase in activity, a recent increase in sun exposure, and residence in the Sunbelt. These were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical significance.

"KF17837: a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist with anticataleptic activity. KF17837 is a novel selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist. Oral administration of KF17837 (2.5, 10.0 and 30.0 mg/kg) significantly ameliorated the cataleptic responses induced by intracerebroventricular administration of an adenosine A2A receptor agonist, CGS 21680 (10 micrograms), in a dose-dependent manner. KF17837 also reduced the catalepsy induced by haloperidol (1 mg/kg i.p.) and by reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.). These anticataleptic effects were exhibited dose dependently at doses from 0.625 and 2.5 mg/kg p.o., respectively. Moreover, KF17837 (0.625 mg/kg p.o.) potentiated the anticataleptic effects of a subthreshold dose of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA; 25 mg/kg i.p.) plus benserazide (6.25 mg/kg i.p.). These results suggested that KF17837 is a centrally active adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and that the dopaminergic function of the nigrostriatal pathway is potentiated by adenosine A2A receptor antagonists. Furthermore, KF17837 may be a useful drug in the treatment of parkinsonism.",0,0,1,0
"Catalepsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine: potentiation, antagonism, tolerance and cross-tolerance in the rat. Previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catalepsy in the rat. Pre-treatment with ketamine produced cross-tolerance to morphine, whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross-tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the cataleptic response; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the brain. The present studies explored the duration of the loss of righting reflex induced by sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, administered simultaneously. There was mutual potentiation between sub-effective doses of ketamine and morphine, but sub-effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully-effective doses of morphine. Latency to the loss of righting reflex, rigidity and behavior on recovery, reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combination. Naloxone inhibited the induced cataleptic effects. The degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub-effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were similar. Rats, tolerant to ketamine-dominant combinations, were cross-tolerant to both drugs, while those tolerant to morphine-dominant combinations were cross-tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross-tolerance or an augmented response to ketamine. While the mutual potentiation, antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catalepsy, differences in latency, rigidity and behavior, asymmetry of cross-tolerance and a widely-different ID50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site.",0,0,1,0
"Acute confusion induced by a high-dose infusion of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid. A 61-year-old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cisplatinum, etoposide, high-dose 5-fluorouracil (2,250 mg/m2/24 hours) and folinic acid for an inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma. He developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion, disorientation and irritability, and then lapsed into a deep coma, lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose (day 2) of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid infusion. This complication reappeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid, which were then the only drugs given. Because folinic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition, neurotoxicity due to high-dose 5-fluorouracil was highly suspected. The pathogenesis of 5-fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a Krebs cycle blockade by fluoroacetate and fluorocitrate, thiamine deficiency, or dihydrouracil dehydrogenase deficiency. High-dose 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancers.

"Nephrotoxicity of cyclosporin A and FK506: inhibition of calcineurin phosphatase. Cyclosporin A (CsA; 50 mg/kg) and Fujimycine (FK506; 5 mg/kg), but not the related macrolide immunosuppressant rapamycin (5 mg/kg), caused a reduction of glomerular filtration rate, degenerative changes of proximal tubular epithelium, and hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in male Wistar rats when given for 10 days. The molecular mechanisms of CsA and FK506 toxicity were investigated. Cyclophilin A and FK506-binding protein, the main intracytoplasmic receptors for CsA and FK506, respectively, were each detected in renal tissue extract. In the kidney, high levels of immunoreactive and enzymatically active calcineurin were found which were inhibited by the immunosuppressants CsA and FK506, but not by rapamycin. Finally, specific immunophilin-drug-calcineurin complexes formed only in the presence of CsA and FK506, but not rapamycin. These results suggest that the nephrotoxic effects of CsA and FK506 is likely mediated through binding to renal immunophilin and inhibiting calcineurin phosphatase.",0,1,1,0
"Heterodimer formation and activity in the human enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase. One of the fundamental questions concerning expression and function of dimeric enzymes involves the impact of naturally occurring mutations on subunit assembly and heterodimer activity . This question is of particular interest for the human enzyme galactose-l-phosphate uridylyl-transferase ( GALT ) , impairment of which results in the inherited metabolic disorder galactosemia , because many if not most patients studied to date are compound heterozygotes rather than true molecular homozygotes . Furthermore , the broad range of phenotypic severity observed in these patients raises the possibility that allelic combination , not just allelic constitution , may play some role in determining outcome . In the work described herein , we have selected two distinct naturally occurring null mutations of GALT , Q188R and R333W , and asked the questions ( i ) what are the impacts of these mutations on subunit assembly , and ( ii ) if heterodimers do form , are they active ? To answer these questions , we have established a yeast system for the coexpression of epitope-tagged alleles of human GALT and investigated both the extent of specific GALT subunit interactions and the activity of defined heterodimer pools . We have found that both homodimers and heterodimers do form involving each of the mutant subunits tested and that both heterodimer pools retain substantial enzymatic activity . These results are significant not only in terms of their implications for furthering our understanding of galactosemia and GALT holoenzyme structure-function relationships but also because the system described may serve as a model for similar studies of other complexes composed of multiple subunits . .",0,0,1,0
"Cardiac transplantation: improved quality of survival with a modified immunosuppressive protocol. The effects on renal function on two different immunosuppressive protocols were evaluated retrospectively in two subsequent groups of heart transplant recipients. In group I, cyclosporine was given before the procedure at a loading dose of 17.5 mg/kg and then continued after the procedure to keep a whole blood level about 1000 ng/ml. In group II, cyclosporine was started only after the procedure at a lower dosage and was complemented by azathioprine, which was used for the first postoperative week. Group II showed a better perioperative renal function as determined by serum blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels. Group II also showed a significant decrease of chronic nephrotoxicity secondary to long-term therapy with cyclosporine. Despite this improvement in late renal function, group II still shows a slow rise in serum creatinine. We think that even these lower dosages of cyclosporine can cause chronic nephrotoxicity and that further modification of the immunosuppressive regimen is required to completely abolish this toxic side effect.",1,1,0,0

"Randomized comparison of olanzapine versus risperidone for the treatment of first-episode schizophrenia: 4-month outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The authors compared 4-month treatment outcomes for olanzapine versus risperidone in patients with first-episode schizophrenia spectrum disorders. METHOD: One hundred twelve subjects (70% male; mean age=23.3 years [SD = 5.1]) with first-episode schizophrenia (75%), schizophreniform disorder (17%), or schizoaffective disorder (8%) were randomly assigned to treatment with olanzapine (2.5-20 mg/day) or risperidone (1-6 mg/day). RESULTS: Response rates did not significantly differ between olanzapine (43.7%, 95% CI=28.8%-58.6%) and risperidone (54.3%, 95% CI=39.9%-68.7%). Among those responding to treatment, more subjects in the olanzapine group (40.9%, 95% CI=16.8%-65.0%) than in the risperidone group (18.9%, 95% CI=0%-39.2%) had subsequent ratings not meeting response criteria. Negative symptom outcomes and measures of parkinsonism and akathisia did not differ between medications. Extrapyramidal symptom severity scores were 1.4 (95% CI=1.2-1.6) with risperidone and 1.2 (95% CI=1.0-1.4) with olanzapine. Significantly more weight gain occurred with olanzapine than with risperidone: the increase in weight at 4 months relative to baseline weight was 17.3% (95% CI=14.2%-20.5%) with olanzapine and 11.3% (95% CI=8.4%-14.3%) with risperidone. Body mass index at baseline and at 4 months was 24.3 (95% CI=22.8-25.7) versus 28.2 (95% CI=26.7-29.7) with olanzapine and 23.9 (95% CI=22.5-25.3) versus 26.7 (95% CI=25.2-28.2) with risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical outcomes with risperidone were equal to those with olanzapine, and response may be more stable. Olanzapine may have an advantage for motor side effects. Both medications caused substantial rapid weight gain, but weight gain was greater with olanzapine.",0,0,1,0

"Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment. Two of 14 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated on a long-term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hypertension. In both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy, yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 (patient 1) and 52 weeks (patient 2) after treatment. In patient 1, plasma levels of deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol were elevated. In patient 2, in addition to an increase in both deoxycorticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels, plasma aldosterone values were raised, with a concomitant suppression of renin levels. Our findings show that long-term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid-related hypertension.",1,0,0,0

"The EWS gene, involved in Ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an RNA binding protein with novel regulatory domains. The EWS gene , which maps to band q12 of human chromosome 22 , is involved in a wide variety of human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma , related primitive neuroectodermal tumors , malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors . In these tumors , the EWS is fused to genes encoding transcriptional activators / repressors , like Fli-1 or erg or ATF 1 or wt1 . To better understand the function of the EWS protein , we cloned the EWS cDNA . Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids . Both alternatively spliced transcripts , EWS and EWS-b , are expressed in a variety of cells . Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs , we studied the RNA binding properties of the EWS protein . The EWS-b protein binds to RNA in vitro and , specifically , to poly G and poly U . The RNA binding activity was localized to the carboxy terminal 86 amino acids , which constitute RGG box . Thus the amino terminal domain of EWS ( NTD-EWS ) , which is involved in chromosome translocation may regulate the specificity of RNA binding activity of EWS . An EWS-erg chimeric protein , which is found in Ewings sarcoma cells , functions as a transcriptional activator .

"Serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving deferoxamine therapy. Visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion-dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous deferoxamine. Twenty-two patients in the affected group had abnormal audiograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8,000 Hz and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 decibels. When deferoxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed, audiograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks, and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asymptomatic. Audiograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent disability. Since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving deferoxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg/kg per dose, therapy was restarted with lower doses, usually 50 mg/kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality, and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstrated. Auditory deterioration and improvement, demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving deferoxamine, respectively, provided convincing evidence for a cause-and-effect relation between deferoxamine administration and ototoxicity. Based on these data, a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of deferoxamine. A dose of 50 mg/kg is recommended in those without audiogram abnormalities. With mild toxicity, a reduction to 30 or 40 mg/kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four weeks. Moderate abnormalities require a reduction of deferoxamine to 25 mg/kg per dose with careful monitoring. In those with symptoms of hearing loss, the drug should be stopped for four weeks, and when the audiogram is stable or improved, therapy should be restarted at 10 to 25 mg/kg per dose. Serial audiograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction.",0,0,1,0
"Enhanced stimulus-induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine-induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor activation. The present study examines the effect of 6-day epinephrine treatment (100 micrograms/kg per h, s.c.) on stimulus-induced (1 Hz) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of vehicle- and epinephrine-treated rats. Renal catecholamine stores and stimulus-induced overflow in the vehicle-treated group consisted of norepinephrine only. However, epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40% of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar degree. Total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was unchanged. Stimulus-induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine-treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidney. This difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extraneuronal uptake blockade. Propranolol had no effect on stimulus-induced overflow in either group. Phentolamine increased stimulus-induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine-treated group. In conclusion, chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter overflow. However, neither alterations in prejunctional beta-adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extraneuronal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alteration. Furthermore, data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha-adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment.",0,1,1,0

"Effects of long-term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. It has been shown that bromocriptine-induced tachycardia, which persisted after adrenalectomy, is (i) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and (ii) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment, supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart. This study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine-induced tachycardia in conscious rats. Isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rate. In control rats, intravenous bromocriptine (150 microg/kg) induced significant hypotension and tachycardia. Bromocriptine-induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment, while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia, an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. domperidone (0.5 mg/kg). Neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pretreatment. In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol-pretreated rats, the isoproterenol-induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced, compared with saline-pretreated rats (the EC50 of the isoproterenol-induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold). These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine-induced tachycardia to bradycardia, an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta-adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart. They suggest that, in normal conscious rats, the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine D2 receptors.",1,1,0,0

"Case-control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory use and end-stage renal disease. BACKGROUND: Studies on the association between the long-term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have given conflicting results. In order to examine this association, a case-control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out. METHODS: The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1, 1995 and November 30, 1997. They were classified according to the underlying disease, which had presumably led them to ESRD. Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals from where the cases arose, also matched by age and sex. Odds ratios were calculated using a conditional logistic model, including potential confounding factors, both for the whole study population and for the various underlying diseases. RESULTS: Five hundred and eighty-three cases and 1190 controls were included in the analysis. Long-term use of any analgesic was associated with an overall odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 0.89-1.66). For specific groups of drugs, the risks were 1.56 (1.05-2.30) for aspirin, 1.03 (0.60-1.76) for pyrazolones, 0.80 (0.39-1.63) for paracetamol, and 0.94 (0.57-1.56) for nonaspirin NSAIDs. The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use, and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [2.35 (1.17-4.72)]. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that long-term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD. However, the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD.",0,1,0,0
"Attenuated disruption of prepulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rats. The development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events, in combination leading to overt disease. We investigated the effect of an early stress, in the form of maternal deprivation, combined with a later stress, simulated by chronic periadolescent corticosterone treatment, on behaviour in rats. Acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment, but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress. Amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted PPI in both non-deprived groups, but was absent in both maternally deprived groups. The serotonin-1A receptor agonist, 8-OH-DPAT, induced a significant disruption of PPI in all groups. Amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all groups. These results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress, caused by maternal deprivation, combined with 'adolescent' stress, simulated by corticosterone treatment, on dopaminergic regulation of PPI. The altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensitisation, or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus.",0,0,1,0
"Atorvastatin prevented and reversed dexamethasone-induced hypertension in the rat. To assess the antioxidant effects of atorvastatin (atorva) on dexamethasone (dex)-induced hypertension, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with atorva 30 mg/kg/day or tap water for 15 days. Dex increased systolic blood pressure (SBP) from 109 +/- 1.8 to 135 +/- 0.6 mmHg and plasma superoxide (5711 +/- 284.9 saline, 7931 +/- 392.8 U/ml dex, P < 0.001).

"A developmental analysis of clonidine's effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production in infant rats. Under controlled conditions, infant rats emit ultrasonic vocalizations during extreme cold exposure and after administration of the alpha(2) adrenoceptor agonist, clonidine. Previous investigations have determined that, in response to clonidine, ultrasound production increases through the 2nd-week postpartum and decreases thereafter. Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern, and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia, we hypothesized that clonidine's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other. Therefore, in the present experiment, the effects of clonidine administration (0.5 mg/kg) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2-, 8-, 15-, and 20-day-old rats. Age-related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables, including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine-induced bradycardia. This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by-product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function.",1,0,0,0

"Elevated Testosterone Dosing Linked to Atherosclerotic Risk in Postmenopausal Females. OBJECTIVES: This investigation aimed to evaluate the protracted impact of androgenic treatment on the progression of atherosclerosis in women who have undergone menopause. METHODS: A community-based study involving 513 naturally postmenopausal women, aged 54 to 67 years, explored the correlation between self-reported, intramuscularly administered high-dose estrogen-testosterone therapy (comprising estradiol and testosterone esters) and aortic atherosclerosis. The diagnosis of aortic atherosclerosis was established through radiographic identification of calcified deposits within the abdominal aorta, which are recognized indicators of intima atherosclerosis. Comparisons were drawn between individuals receiving hormone therapy and those who had never used it. RESULTS: Twenty-five women reported utilizing intramuscular hormone therapy for a duration of one year or more. Severe aortic atherosclerosis was observed in nearly half of these users (n=11), whereas among women not using hormones, severe aortic atherosclerosis was present in less than 20% (Odds Ratio 3.1; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.1-8.5, adjusted for age, time since menopause, smoking status, and body mass index). This relationship remained significant following further adjustments for diabetes, cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, or alcohol consumption. No discernible association was detected for hormone therapy use spanning less than one year. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that high-dose testosterone therapy might negatively influence atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women, indicating that androgen replacement in this demographic may carry potential risks.",1,0,0,0

"Fentanyl omission in sevoflurane day surgery: reduced nausea and vomiting without increased pain. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common after sevoflurane anesthesia. Fentanyl, a frequent supplement, may contribute to PONV while also offering analgesia. This double-blind study evaluated PONV and pain incidence and severity over 24 hours in 216 adult day surgery patients receiving sevoflurane. Patients were randomized to receive 1 1 fentanyl, no fentanyl, or fentanyl plus dexamethasone. Omitting fentanyl did not decrease overall PONV incidence but significantly reduced vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea before discharge, from 20% (fentanyl) and 17% (fentanyl-dexamethasone) to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic needs also decreased from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no significant impact on PONV. When fentanyl groups were combined, avoiding opioids led to further significant reductions in PONV and nausea before discharge, from 35% to 22% (P = 0.049) and 33% to 19% (P = 0.035) respectively, and a decrease in 24-hour nausea from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic requirements were not affected by fentanyl omission. Although fentanyl reduced minor intraoperative movement, it lacked a sevoflurane-sparing effect and increased respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. Therefore, fentanyl exacerbates PONV without enhancing postoperative analgesia and causes adverse cardiorespiratory effects, rendering it an unnecessary and potentially harmful sevoflurane supplement in day surgery.",1,0,0,0
"The Impact of Fentanyl Omission on Postoperative Outcomes in Sevoflurane-Anesthetized Day Surgery Patients. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) frequently follows sevoflurane induction and maintenance. Fentanyl, a common anesthetic adjunct, might exacerbate PONV despite its analgesic properties. This double-blind investigation assessed PONV and pain incidence and severity within 24 hours post-sevoflurane anesthesia in 216 adult day surgery patients. Participants were randomized to receive 1 1 fentanyl, no fentanyl, or fentanyl supplemented with dexamethasone. Fentanyl omission did not diminish the overall PONV incidence but did significantly reduce vomiting and/or moderate-to-severe nausea prior to discharge from 20% (fentanyl) and 17% (fentanyl-dexamethasone) to 5% (P = 0.013). Antiemetic demand also fell from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone demonstrated no significant effect on PONV. Analysis combining the fentanyl groups showed that avoiding opioids further reduced PONV and nausea pre-discharge from 35% to 22% (P = 0.049) and 33% to 19% (P = 0.035), respectively, and decreased 24-hour nausea from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and analgesic needs remained unchanged by fentanyl exclusion. While fentanyl reduced minor intraoperative movement, it exhibited no sevoflurane-sparing effect and intensified respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. Consequently, since fentanyl intensified PONV without improving postoperative pain and induced adverse cardiorespiratory events, it appears to be an unneeded and possibly deleterious supplement to sevoflurane in day surgery.",1,0,0,0
"A Reduced Incidence of Nausea and Vomiting, Without Increased Pain, Following Fentanyl Avoidance in Sevoflurane Day Surgery. Sevoflurane-based anesthesia often leads to frequent postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Fentanyl, a frequently administered supplement, might contribute to this, although it also offers pain relief. This double-blind study investigated the frequency and intensity of PONV and pain during the initial 24 hours after sevoflurane anesthesia among 216 adult day surgery patients. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: administration of 1 1 fentanyl, no fentanyl, or fentanyl combined with dexamethasone. The exclusion of fentanyl did not lower the total incidence of PONV but significantly reduced the occurrence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea before patient discharge, specifically from 20% with fentanyl and 17% with fentanyl-dexamethasone to 5% (P = 0.013). Similarly, the requirement for antiemetics decreased from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone had no notable impact on the incidence or severity of PONV. Further analysis, combining the two fentanyl groups, revealed additional significant advantages from opioid avoidance, decreasing PONV and nausea prior to discharge from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, while 24-hour nausea diminished from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain levels and analgesic consumption were unaffected by fentanyl's omission. Although fentanyl did lessen minor intraoperative movement, it conferred no sevoflurane-sparing benefit and elevated respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. In conclusion, given that fentanyl aggravated PONV without improving postoperative pain and also generated adverse cardiorespiratory effects, it is considered an unnecessary, and potentially harmful, adjunct to sevoflurane in day surgery.",1,0,0,0
"Benefits of Fentanyl Withdrawal on Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting Incidence, Without Analgesic Compromise, in Sevoflurane Day Surgery. The use of sevoflurane for anesthetic induction and maintenance is often associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).

This double-blind investigation enrolled 216 adult day surgery patients to assess the prevalence and intensity of PONV and pain during the initial 24-hour postoperative period following sevoflurane anesthesia. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms: receiving 1 1 fentanyl, no fentanyl, or fentanyl supplemented with dexamethasone. Withdrawal of fentanyl did not decrease the overall incidence of PONV, but it markedly reduced the occurrence of vomiting and/or moderate to severe nausea before discharge, from 20% (fentanyl group) and 17% (fentanyl-dexamethasone group) to 5% (P = 0.013). Concurrently, antiemetic requirements were lowered from 24% and 31% to 7% (P = 0.0012). Dexamethasone demonstrated no significant impact on PONV frequency or severity. When the two fentanyl groups were consolidated, avoiding opioid administration resulted in further notable reductions in PONV and nausea prior to discharge, specifically from 35% and 33% to 22% and 19% (P = 0.049 and P = 0.035), respectively, and a decrease in nausea over the first 24 hours from 42% to 27% (P = 0.034). Pain severity and the need for analgesics remained unchanged following fentanyl's removal. Although fentanyl did mitigate minor intraoperative movement, it failed to provide a sevoflurane-sparing effect and was linked to increased respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. Consequently, because fentanyl worsened PONV without improving postoperative pain and also contributed to unfavorable cardiorespiratory outcomes, it appears to be an unneeded and potentially deleterious addition to sevoflurane for day surgery procedures.",1,0,0,0

Measurements, including blood pressure, pulse rate, conjunctiva and cornea examination, intraocular pressure (IOP), pupil diameter, basal tear secretion, and upper and lower eyelid margin reflex distances, were recorded at baseline and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 hours following instillation. Ocular hypotensive effects were statistically significant in apraclonidine-treated eyes throughout the study, and also in contralateral eyes from three hours after topical administration of 1% apraclonidine. Reductions in systolic blood pressure were statistically, but not clinically, significant. No significant alterations were observed in diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, or basal tear secretion. Conjunctival blanching and mydriasis were common findings, as was frequent upper lid retraction. Although elevations of the upper lid margin in the majority of subjects were less than 2 mm and did not cause a noticeable change in appearance, one subject experienced mechanical entropion and marked corneal abrasion 3 hours after medication instillation.

"Direct Cardiac HCN Pacemaker Channel Inhibition by Clonidine. BACKGROUND: Inhibiting cardiac sympathetic activity is a vital strategy for managing cardiovascular conditions such as arrhythmias, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. While clonidine, an antisympathetic agent, is primarily understood to act via presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptor activation, the involvement of other target proteins in its in vivo effects has been proposed. METHODS AND RESULTS: To investigate clonidine's pharmacological effects independently of alpha2-adrenoceptors, we developed mice with a targeted deletion of all three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-). Although alpha2ABC-/- mice were entirely unresponsive to clonidine's analgesic and hypnotic properties, clonidine significantly lowered their heart rate by up to 150 bpm. The clonidine-induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice represented 32.3% (at 10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (at 100 microg/kg) of the effect observed in wild-type mice. A similar bradycardic response to clonidine was observed in isolated, spontaneously beating right atria from both alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type animals. Clonidine also inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells, as well as the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells. Consequently, by blocking I(f), clonidine decreased the slope of diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from both wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine in vivo in gene-targeted mice, suggesting clonidine-like compounds as potential novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors.",1,0,0,0
"Clonidine as a Direct Inhibitor of Cardiac Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Pacemaker Channels. BACKGROUND: Suppressing cardiac sympathetic tone is a crucial therapeutic approach for cardiovascular ailments, including cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and chronic heart failure. The primary mechanism attributed to the antisympathetic drug clonidine involves activating presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors; however, the contribution of other protein targets to clonidine's physiological actions has been hypothesized. METHODS AND RESULTS: To ascertain if clonidine exerts pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors, mice lacking all three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha2ABC-/-) were engineered. While these alpha2ABC-/- mice showed no response to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine, the drug markedly reduced their heart rate, by as much as 150 bpm. In conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice, the clonidine-induced bradycardia accounted for 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of the effect seen in wild-type counterparts. A comparable bradycardic action of clonidine was observed in spontaneously beating right atria isolated from both alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type mice. Clonidine was found to inhibit the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and also the I(f)-producing hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels when expressed in HEK293 cells. This I(f) blockade by clonidine subsequently led to a reduction in the slope of diastolic depolarization and the rate of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from both wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: The direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels plays a role in the in vivo bradycardic effects of clonidine in gene-targeted mice, thereby identifying clonidine-like molecules as promising scaffolds for novel HCN channel inhibitors.",1,0,0,0
"A Novel Mechanism: Clonidine's Direct Inhibition of Cardiac HCN Channels. BACKGROUND: Strategies to inhibit cardiac sympathetic tone are critical in treating cardiovascular diseases such as arrhythmias, coronary heart disease, and chronic heart failure. The primary mode of action for the antisympathetic agent clonidine is largely attributed to activating presynaptic alpha2-adrenoceptors, yet alternative target proteins have been postulated to mediate its in vivo actions. METHODS AND RESULTS: To evaluate clonidine's pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptor involvement, we generated alpha2ABC-/- mice, which lack all three alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes. These alpha2ABC-/- mice were entirely non-responsive to the analgesic and hypnotic actions of clonidine; however, clonidine significantly decreased their heart rate by up to 150 bpm. The bradycardic effect of clonidine in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice constituted 32.3% (10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (100 microg/kg) of that observed in wild-type mice. A similar clonidine-induced bradycardia was evident in isolated, spontaneously beating right atria from both alpha2ABC-knockout and wild-type animals. Furthermore, clonidine directly inhibited the native pacemaker current (I(f)) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells, as well as the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) 2 and HCN4 channels when expressed in transfected HEK293 cells. This I(f) blockade resulted in clonidine reducing the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from both wild-type and alpha2ABC-knockout mice. CONCLUSIONS: The direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels significantly contributes to the in vivo bradycardic effects of clonidine in genetically modified mice, positioning clonidine-like compounds as new templates for future HCN channel inhibitors.",1,0,0,0

These alpha2ABC-/- mice displayed complete unresponsiveness to clonidine's analgesic and hypnotic effects; nevertheless, clonidine notably lowered their heart rate, achieving reductions of up to 150 bpm. In conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice, the clonidine-induced bradycardia represented 32.3% (at 10 microg/kg) and 26.6% (at 100 microg/kg) of the effect observed in wild-type animals.

"The Impact of Intravenous Metoprolol, Alone or with Glucagon, on Dobutamine-Induced Myocardial Ischemia. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted in a community hospital, aimed to determine the effect of metoprolol on dobutamine stress testing, incorporating technetium-99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomography imaging and ST-segment monitoring, and to assess the influence of intravenous glucagon on metoprolol's actions. The study enrolled 22 patients with documented reversible perfusion defects. Standard dobutamine stress tests were performed. During the initial visit, no therapy was administered prior to dobutamine; for subsequent visits, patients were randomized to receive either intravenous metoprolol or intravenous metoprolol combined with 1 mg of glucagon. Metoprolol was titrated to achieve a resting predobutamine heart rate below 65 beats/minute or a total intravenous dose of 20 mg. Metoprolol alone significantly reduced maximum heart rate by 31%, summed stress scores by 29%, and summed difference scores by 43% compared to control. The combination of metoprolol and glucagon also decreased maximum heart rate by 29% versus control, but summed stress and summed difference scores, although 18% and 30% lower respectively than control, were not significantly reduced. No significant disparities were observed in any parameter between the metoprolol and metoprolol-glucagon groups.

"Anorexigen Use and Pulmonary Hypertension in North America: A Surveillance Study. BACKGROUND: The development of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) has been linked to appetite suppressant use in Europe. In the United States, fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widespread but were withdrawn in September 1997 due to safety concerns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective surveillance study of patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 major North American referral centers. Data collected from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997, included the etiology and severity of pulmonary hypertension. Patients without an identifiable cause were classified as PPH. A history of drug exposure, specifically for antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines, was also obtained. RESULTS: Of the 579 patients studied, 205 presented with PPH and 374 with secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH). Anorexigen use was prevalent in both groups. However, among the surveyed medications, only fenfluramines demonstrated a significant preferential association with PPH compared to SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use exceeding 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). The strength of this association increased with longer duration of use and was more pronounced in recent users. Furthermore, a notable 11.4% of SPH patients reported anorexigen use. CONCLUSION: The significant magnitude, duration-dependent increase, and fenfluramine-specific nature of this association with PPH are consistent with prior studies suggesting a causal link between fenfluramines and PPH. The high prevalence of anorexigen use in SPH patients additionally raises the possibility that these drugs may precipitate pulmonary hypertension in individuals with pre-existing conditions.",1,0,0,0
"The Relationship Between Anorexigen Exposure and Pulmonary Hypertension: Insights from a US Surveillance Program. BACKGROUND: Appetite suppressant use in Europe has been associated with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Fenfluramine appetite suppressants gained widespread use in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 due to concerns regarding adverse effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was performed on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers across North America. Data collected between September 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997, encompassed the cause and severity of pulmonary hypertension. Patients with no identifiable cause were categorized as PPH. Information on drug exposure, particularly to antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines, was also gathered. RESULTS: The study involved 579 patients, comprising 205 with PPH and 374 with secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH). Anorexigen use was frequently observed in both cohorts. Nevertheless, among the medications investigated, only the fenfluramines showed a statistically significant preferential association with PPH versus SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use exceeding 6 months: 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). This association intensified with prolonged usage and was more evident in recent users than in remote users. Notably, 11.4% of SPH patients reported a history of anorexigen use. CONCLUSION: The observed strong association with PPH, its augmentation with increased duration of use, and its specificity for fenfluramines are consistent with previous research indicating a causal relationship between fenfluramines and PPH. The high prevalence of anorexigen use among patients with SPH also suggests these drugs may precipitate pulmonary hypertension in individuals with underlying predisposing conditions.",1,0,0,0
"Drug-Induced Pulmonary Hypertension in the United States: A Surveillance of Anorexigen Use. BACKGROUND: Primary pulmonary hypertension has been associated with appetite suppressant use in Europe, leading to concerns in the US where fenfluramines were extensively used before their withdrawal in September 1997 due to safety issues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted at 12 prominent North American referral centers. Patient data, including PH etiology and severity, were collected from September 1, 1996, to December 31, 1997. Cases of PH without an identifiable cause were classified as PPH. Detailed histories of exposure to drugs, particularly anorexigens, antidepressants, and amphetamines, were recorded. RESULTS: Of 579 patients analyzed, 205 had PPH and 374 had SPH. Anorexigen use was prevalent in both groups. However, among the medications assessed, only fenfluramines exhibited a statistically significant and preferential association with PPH compared to SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use exceeding 6 months: 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4).

"Assessing Anorexigen-Related Pulmonary Hypertension Risk in the United States: North American Surveillance Findings. BACKGROUND: The link between European appetite suppressants and primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) raised concerns, especially after fenfluramines saw widespread use and subsequent withdrawal in the United States in September 1997 due to adverse effect concerns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective surveillance study monitored patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 major referral centers across North America between September 1, 1996, and December 31, 1997. Data gathered included the cause and severity of pulmonary hypertension, with PPH defined as cases lacking an identifiable etiology. Drug exposure history, specifically for antidepressants, anorexigens, and amphetamines, was meticulously collected. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 579 patients: 205 with PPH and 374 with secondary pulmonary hypertension (SPH). While anorexigen use was common in both groups, only fenfluramines demonstrated a significant preferential association with PPH when compared to SPH (adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months, 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.7 to 32.4). This association was found to be stronger with increased duration of use and in more recent users. An unexpected 11.4% of SPH patients also reported anorexigen use. CONCLUSION: The strong magnitude, dose-response relationship, and fenfluramine specificity of the observed association with PPH are consistent with previous studies, reinforcing a causal link between fenfluramines and PPH. The considerable prevalence of anorexigen use in SPH patients further implies a potential for these drugs to precipitate pulmonary hypertension in individuals already possessing underlying conditions.",1,0,0,0

"The Impact of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure on Pulmonary Shunt and Cardiovascular Parameters during Nitroprusside-Induced Hypotension. An investigation was conducted into the influence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) in 12 canine subjects. Observations were made both prior to and during an infusion of sodium nitroprusside, which induced a 40-50 percent reduction in mean arterial blood pressure. Pre-nitroprusside, 5 cm H2O CPAP led to a statistically significant reduction (P < .05) in arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly modify heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Application of 10 cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion further diminished arterial blood pressure, while concurrently increasing heart rate and decreasing both cardiac output and QS/QT significantly. Nitroprusside alone resulted in significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, alongside increases in heart rate, yet cardiac output and QS/QT remained unchanged. During nitroprusside administration, 5 cm H2O CPAP caused no additional alterations to these variables. However, 10 cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These findings indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates sufficient to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 percent do not affect cardiac output or QS/QT. Furthermore, during nitroprusside, modest CPAP levels have minimal impact on cardiovascular dynamics, whereas elevated CPAP levels (10 cm H2O), while reducing QS/QT, cause substantial reductions in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",1,0,0,0
"Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Shunt Responses to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Hypotensive States Induced by Nitroprusside. We examined the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) in a cohort of 12 dogs. The study protocol involved observations before and during the infusion of sodium nitroprusside, which was titrated to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 percent. Prior to nitroprusside administration, 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly lowered arterial blood pressure (P < .05), without causing significant changes in heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Subsequently, 10 cm H2O CPAP applied before nitroprusside produced an additional decline in arterial blood pressure, alongside a significant elevation in heart rate and reductions in both cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside infusion independently led to substantial decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, and increases in heart rate, but did not alter cardiac output or QS/QT. The application of 5 cm H2O CPAP concurrent with nitroprusside did not elicit further changes in any measured parameters. Conversely, 10 cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside infusion resulted in decreased arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These results demonstrate that nitroprusside infusion rates, which achieve a 40-50 percent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure, do not modify cardiac output or QS/QT. Moreover, while under nitroprusside, low levels of CPAP do not profoundly affect cardiovascular dynamics, but higher levels of CPAP (10 cm H2O), despite reducing QS/QT, lead to pronounced decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",1,0,0,0
"Evaluation of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Effects on Pulmonary Shunt and Hemodynamics During Nitroprusside-Induced Hypotension. The influence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular function and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) was investigated in 12 canines. Measurements were taken both prior to and following the initiation of sodium nitroprusside infusion, which achieved a 40-50 percent reduction in mean arterial blood pressure. Before nitroprusside, a 5 cm H2O CPAP level significantly lowered arterial blood pressure (P < .05), but did not significantly alter heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. Applying 10 cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside resulted in a further decrease in arterial blood pressure, a significant increase in heart rate, and significant decreases in cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside infusion alone induced significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, along with increases in heart rate, yet did not affect cardiac output or QS/QT. During nitroprusside, 5 cm H2O CPAP failed to induce additional changes in any of the aforementioned variables. However, 10 cm H2O CPAP during nitroprusside diminished arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. The data suggest that nitroprusside infusion rates causing a 40-50 percent decrease in mean arterial blood pressure do not modify cardiac output or QS/QT. It is further indicated that during nitroprusside, low CPAP levels do not substantially alter cardiovascular dynamics, while high CPAP levels (10 cm H2O), although reducing QS/QT, result in considerable decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",1,0,0,0
"The Interplay of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure with Pulmonary Shunt and Cardiovascular Parameters in Nitroprusside-Induced Hypotension. Researchers examined the consequences of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt (QS/QT) within 12 dogs. This study involved assessments both preceding and during sodium nitroprusside administration, which lowered the mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 percent. Prior to the nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP caused a significant reduction (P < .05) in arterial blood pressure, but did not significantly modify heart rate, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, or QS/QT. When 10 cm H2O CPAP was applied before nitroprusside, it led to an additional decline in arterial blood pressure, a significant elevation in heart rate, and significant reductions in cardiac output and QS/QT. Nitroprusside by itself produced marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance, and increases in heart rate, without changing cardiac output or QS/QT. During the nitroprusside infusion, 5 cm H2O CPAP did not introduce further changes to any of the measured variables. Nevertheless, 10 cm H2O CPAP in combination with nitroprusside resulted in decreases in arterial blood pressure, cardiac output, and QS/QT. These findings establish that nitroprusside infusion rates designed to reduce mean arterial blood pressure by 40-50 percent do not alter cardiac output or QS/QT. Furthermore, in the presence of nitroprusside, low CPAP levels do not substantially influence cardiovascular dynamics, yet high CPAP levels (10 cm H2O), while effectively decreasing QS/QT, provoke significant declines in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output.",1,0,0,0

"Amiodarone-Associated Torsade de Pointes during Bladder Irrigation: An Atypical Case Presentation. This report details an instance of torsade de pointes (TdP) occurring within four days of initiating oral amiodarone treatment. Similar to previous observations, this TdP episode was observed amidst several contributing factors, specifically hypokalemia and elevated digoxin levels. A brief QT interval prolongation during bladder irrigation directly preceded the TdP event. Given the established link between bradycardia and acquired TdP exacerbation, the authors hypothesize that heightened vagal tone, induced by the bladder irrigation maneuver, combined with amiodarone therapy, led to this amiodarone-triggered proarrhythmia. Crucially, a subsequent bladder irrigation performed without amiodarone, despite the presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, did not precipitate TdP.",1,0,0,0

The TdP episode was specifically triggered by transient QT interval prolongation during bladder irrigation. It is recognized that acquired TdP is worsened by bradycardia. The authors propose that the elevated vagal tone associated with bladder irrigation, a known vagal maneuver, when concurrent with amiodarone therapy, resulted in amiodarone-mediated proarrhythmia.

This TdP event, aligning with other published reports, unfolded against a backdrop of several aggravating factors, such as hypokalemia and digoxin excess. Notably, transient QT interval prolongation observed during bladder irrigation served as the immediate precursor to the TdP episode. Acknowledging the known exacerbating effect of bradycardia on acquired TdP, the authors postulate that the increased vagal tone from bladder irrigation—functioning as a vagal maneuver—in conjunction with amiodarone treatment, culminated in an amiodarone-induced proarrhythmic effect.

Similar to observations detailed in other publications, this particular instance of TdP was complicated by a confluence of exacerbating elements, specifically hypokalemia and an elevated digoxin concentration. The episode of TdP was directly precipitated by a temporary prolongation of the QT interval that occurred during bladder irrigation. Given the well-established role of bradycardia in exacerbating acquired TdP, the authors put forth the hypothesis that the enhanced vagal tone, a physiological response to bladder irrigation as a vagal maneuver, when combined with concurrent amiodarone administration, instigated the amiodarone-induced proarrhythmia. Furthermore, a subsequent bladder irrigation, conducted in the absence of amiodarone therapy, did not result in TdP despite the persistent presence of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia.",1,0,0,0

"Continuous Ketamine Anesthesia in Resource-Limited Conflict and Tropical Surgical Settings. Successful application of a continuous intravenous ketamine anesthesia protocol was demonstrated during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in northern Uganda in 1999. This technique facilitated 64 operations on 62 patients, ranging in age from 6 weeks to 70 years, for limb and abdominal procedures, including caesarian sections and neonatal interventions. Operations, some lasting up to 2 hours, were performed effectively without advanced equipment such as pulse oximeters or ventilators, with patients breathing spontaneously on air/oxygen. Following premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate, and local anesthesia, and standard ketamine induction, a maintenance infusion of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine was found to be safe and efficacious. Bedside clinical monitoring, primarily heart rate, was emphasized. Diazepam, when not contraindicated, served as the essential adjunct to ketamine, mitigating its cardiovascular effects and reducing the incidence and severity of operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anesthetic blocks proved beneficial for lowering postoperative analgesia needs. An antisialogue was generally not required for procedures up to 2 hours, with glycopyrrolate being the preferred agent due to its minimal psychotropic and chronotropic impact, particularly in hot climates. This experience suggests the potential utility of this technique in civilian emergency scenarios, such as outdoor life-saving surgery or mass casualty incidents requiring rapid procedures like amputation and extrication.",1,0,0,0
"Racemic Ketamine for Continuous Intravenous Anesthesia in War and Tropical Surgical Contexts. Continuous intravenous ketamine anesthesia was successfully employed for 64 surgical procedures in 62 patients, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, during the Somalia civil war in 1994 and in north Uganda in 1999. These interventions encompassed limb and abdominal surgeries, including caesarian sections and neonatal operations. The technique allowed operations, some extending up to 2 hours, to be conducted safely and effectively despite the absence of advanced medical devices like pulse oximeters or ventilators, with patients maintaining spontaneous ventilation on air/oxygen. After premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate, and local anesthesia, and a standard ketamine induction dose, a maintenance infusion of 10-20 microg/kg/min of ketamine proved both safe and effective. Clinical monitoring at the bedside, with a strong emphasis on heart rate, was crucial. Diazepam, unless medically contraindicated or risky, was identified as the sole essential complementary drug to ketamine, buffering its cardiovascular responses and diminishing the duration and intensity of both operative and postoperative hallucinations. Local anesthetic blocks were advantageous in reducing the necessity for postoperative analgesia. Antisialogues were typically unneeded for operations lasting up to 2 hours, with glycopyrrolate being the optimal choice due to its minimal psychotropic and chronotropic effects, especially relevant in hot conditions.

"Application and Efficacy of Continuous Intravenous Ketamine Anesthesia in War-Affected and Tropical Regions. In 1994 during the Somalia civil war and in 1999 in north Uganda, a continuous intravenous ketamine anesthesia technique was successfully utilized for 64 operations on 62 patients. This diverse patient cohort, aged from 6 weeks to 70 years, underwent limb and abdominal surgeries, including caesarian sections and procedures on neonates. Operations, which could last up to 2 hours, were performed effectively despite the lack of sophisticated equipment like pulse oximeters or ventilators, with patients maintaining spontaneous ventilation using only air/oxygen. Following premedication with diazepam, glycopyrrolate, and local anesthesia, and an initial standard dose of ketamine for induction, a maintenance dose of 10-20 microg/kg/min was found to be safe and effective. Clinical monitoring, performed at the bedside and heavily relying on heart rate, was a critical component of patient management. Diazepam emerged as the sole essential adjunct to ketamine, unless contraindicated, due to its ability to moderate cardiovascular responses and reduce the severity and duration of operative and postoperative hallucinations.

"Diagnostic Performance of Troponin I in Cocaine-Related Chest Pain Patients. Accurately diagnosing myocardial infarction (MI) presents a challenge in individuals experiencing cocaine-induced chest pain, primarily due to baseline electrocardiogram anomalies and elevated biomarkers not indicative of myocardial necrosis. Troponin measurement could offer improved diagnostic value in this population. This study aimed to evaluate outcomes linked to troponin positivity in patients admitted for MI exclusion following cocaine-related chest pain. Outcomes were investigated in patients hospitalized for suspected MI after cocaine consumption. A rapid rule-in protocol was employed, involving serial measurements of creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) over an eight-hour period. Key outcomes included CK-MB MI (defined as CK-MB ≥ 8 ng/mL with a relative index [(CK-MB x 100)/total CK] ≥ 4), cardiac death, and substantial coronary artery disease (≥50% stenosis). Among the 246 admitted patients, 34 (14%) fulfilled the CK-MB criteria for MI, while 38 (16%) displayed cTnI elevations. Angiography was conducted on 29 of the 38 cTnI-positive patients, revealing significant disease in 25 (86%).

"Intracoronary Cocaine Infusion's Impact on Human Left Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Performance. Previous research in canines demonstrated that substantial intravenous cocaine doses lead to significant impairment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function and an elevation in LV end-diastolic pressure. This investigation aimed to determine how a high intracoronary cocaine concentration affects LV systolic and diastolic function in human subjects. Twenty patients (14 males, 6 females; ages 39-72 years), undergoing cardiac catheterization for chest pain assessment, had their heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), and LV volumes and ejection fraction measured. Measurements were taken before and during the final 2-3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion of either saline (n=10, controls) or 1 mg/min cocaine hydrochloride (n=10). No changes were observed with saline administration. For the cocaine group, the drug concentration in coronary sinus blood averaged 3.0±0.4 mg/L, a level comparable to that reported in fatalities from cocaine intoxication. Cocaine did not induce significant alterations in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume. However, it did lead to elevated systolic and mean arterial pressures, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, and an augmented LV end-systolic volume, concurrently with a reduced LV ejection fraction. These findings indicate that in humans, intracoronary cocaine infusion, at a dosage sufficient to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood, results in compromised LV systolic and diastolic performance.",1,0,0,0
"Human Left Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Function: Response to Intracoronary Cocaine Administration. Prior studies in dogs revealed that substantial intravenous cocaine administration severely impairs left ventricular (LV) systolic function and elevates LV end-diastolic pressure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a significant intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic capabilities in human subjects. In 20 individuals (14 men, 6 women; 39 to 72 years old) undergoing cardiac catheterization for chest pain, heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and dP/dt, LV volumes, and ejection fraction were assessed. These measurements occurred before and during the conclusion of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion (the last 2 to 3 minutes) of either saline (n=10, controls) or cocaine hydrochloride at 1 mg/min (n=10). Saline infusion produced no changes in any measured variable. With cocaine, the mean (± SD) drug concentration in coronary sinus blood reached 3.0±0.4 mg/L, a magnitude akin to that observed in individuals who succumbed to cocaine intoxication. Cocaine did not significantly alter heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume. Nevertheless, it prompted increases in systolic and mean arterial pressures, LV end-diastolic pressure, and LV end-systolic volume, alongside a reduction in LV ejection fraction. Consequently, in humans, an intracoronary cocaine infusion that achieves a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood leads to a decline in LV systolic and diastolic function.",1,0,0,0
"Assessment of Intracoronary Cocaine's Influence on Human Left Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Capacity. High-dose intravenous cocaine in canines has been shown to profoundly impair left ventricular (LV) systolic function and increase LV end-diastolic pressure. This study sought to ascertain the effects of a substantial intracoronary cocaine concentration on human LV systolic and diastolic function. Cardiac catheterization patients (n=20; 14 men, 6 women; 39-72 years) presenting with chest pain had their heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), LV volumes, and ejection fraction monitored. Measurements were taken prior to and during the terminal 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion. Ten patients received saline (controls), while the other ten received 1 mg/min cocaine hydrochloride. Saline administration yielded no changes in any parameter. In the cocaine cohort, coronary sinus blood samples exhibited a mean (± SD) cocaine concentration of 3.0±0.4 mg/L, a level comparable to that documented in fatal cocaine intoxications. While heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), and LV end-diastolic volume remained unaffected, cocaine administration resulted in elevated systolic and mean arterial pressures, an increased LV end-diastolic pressure, and an augmented LV end-systolic volume. Simultaneously, LV ejection fraction declined. Therefore, in human subjects, an intracoronary cocaine infusion that generates a high drug concentration in the coronary sinus culminates in a degradation of LV systolic and diastolic performance.",1,0,0,0
"The Impact of Intracoronary Cocaine Infusion on Left Ventricular Systolic and Diastolic Function in Humans. Large doses of intravenous cocaine have previously been shown to cause profound left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and elevated LV end-diastolic pressure in dogs. This investigation was conducted to determine the impact of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on LV systolic and diastolic function in humans. Twenty patients (14 men, 6 women, aged 39 to 72 years) who presented for cardiac catheterization due to chest pain were studied. Heart rate, systemic arterial pressure, LV pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), LV volumes, and ejection fraction were quantified both before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15-minute intracoronary infusion. Ten patients served as controls, receiving saline, while the other ten received cocaine hydrochloride at 1 mg/min. No variables changed with saline infusion. In the cocaine group, the drug concentration in blood from the coronary sinus was measured at 3.0±0.4 (mean±SD) mg/L, a level of similar magnitude to that reported in cocaine abusers who died from intoxication. Cocaine did not induce significant changes in heart rate, LV dP/dt (positive or negative), or LV end-diastolic volume. However, it led to rises in systolic and mean arterial pressures, an increase in LV end-diastolic pressure, and an expansion of LV end-systolic volume, concurrently causing a reduction in LV ejection fraction. In conclusion, an intracoronary infusion of cocaine in humans, administered at a dose sufficient to achieve a high drug concentration within coronary sinus blood, precipitates a decline in LV systolic and diastolic performance.",1,0,0,0

Employing 10 distinct cDNA probes, Southern blot analysis confirmed an uncompromised apoB gene, exhibiting no substantial insertions, deletions, or structural alterations. Northern and slot blot methodologies applied to total liver mRNA from HBL patients revealed apoB mRNA of appropriate size but in markedly depleted quantities. Immunohistochemical staining identified apoB protein within HBL hepatocytes; however, its concentration was notably lower than that observed in control specimens. No apoB could be detected in the plasma of HBL patients using an ELISA protocol. These comprehensive data are most consistent with a mutational event within the coding sequence of the apoB gene in HBL patients, culminating in a dysfunctional apoB protein and instability of apoB mRNA. These results establish a clear divergence from prior observations in abetalipoproteinemia, which was characterized by heightened hepatic apoB mRNA levels and intracellular deposition of hepatic apoB protein.",0,1,0,0

"Initial Experience with Rapamycin Immunosuppression Conversion in Renal Transplant Recipients. This study aimed to assess the impact of converting to rapamycin (RAPA) in patients experiencing cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity. Twenty renal transplant recipients transitioned to a fixed 5 mg/day dose of RAPA between 0 and 204 months post-transplant. Initial dose adjustments did not involve drug monitoring. Indications for the switch included chronic CsA or Tac nephrotoxicity (12 cases), acute CsA or Tac toxicity (3), severe facial dysmorphism (2), PTLD in remission (2), and hepatotoxicity (1). Patients were followed for 7 to 24 months. Results showed a significant reduction in serum creatinine levels from 233+/-34 to 210+/-56 micromol/liter (P<0.05) at 6 months in the 12 patients with chronic nephrotoxicity.

"A Preliminary Evaluation of Rapamycin Immunosuppression Transition in Renal Transplant Recipients. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the consequences of converting patients with cyclosporine (CsA) or tacrolimus (Tac) toxicity to rapamycin (RAPA). A cohort of twenty renal transplant recipients received a fixed daily dose of 5 mg rapamycin, with the switch occurring between 0 and 204 months post-transplant.

"Investigation of Hepatocellular Oxidant Stress Subsequent to Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. Acute hepatic dysfunction, evidenced by the release of hepatocellular enzymes into plasma, diminished bile flow, and hepatic neutrophil sequestration, arises from reperfusion of ischemic intestine. The precise mechanisms of this acute liver damage remain unclear. This investigation sought to ascertain the involvement of oxidants in this hepatic injury and to evaluate the comparative utility of various indirect in vivo oxidant exposure assessment techniques. A standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in rats. Hepatic tissue samples were analyzed for lipid peroxidation byproducts and for the concentrations of oxidized and reduced glutathione. Total hepatic glutathione levels exhibited no alteration following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. A significant elevation in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was observed after 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. Conversely, no increase in any lipid peroxidation products was associated with this injury. The observed rise in hepatic tissue GSSG during intestinal reperfusion indicates that hepatocytes are subjected to an oxidant stress. The absence of a substantial increase in lipid peroxidation products implies that the oxidant stress is not severe enough to induce irreversible damage to hepatocyte cell membranes. These findings further suggest that quantifying tissue GSSG might serve as a more sensitive biomarker for oxidant stress than measuring lipid peroxidation products.",0,1,0,0
"Hepatic Oxidant Stress Response to Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. Acute liver dysfunction, marked by hepatocellular enzyme leakage into plasma, decreased bile production, and neutrophil accumulation within the liver, develops after reperfusing ischemic bowel. The underlying pathological mechanisms of this acute hepatic insult are not yet elucidated. This study aimed to determine if oxidants play a role in this liver injury and to assess the comparative efficacy of several indirect in vivo methods for detecting oxidant exposure. Rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion protocol. Hepatic tissue was subsequently analyzed for lipid peroxidation markers and for oxidized and reduced glutathione levels. No change in total hepatic glutathione was detected following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. However, oxidized glutathione (GSSG) levels significantly increased after 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. No concomitant increase in any lipid peroxidation products was observed. This increase in hepatic tissue GSSG during intestinal reperfusion points to the exposure of hepatocytes to oxidant stress. The lack of a significant rise in lipid peroxidation products suggests that the oxidant stress magnitude is insufficient to cause irreversible damage to hepatocyte membranes. Furthermore, these data propose that GSSG measurement in tissue could be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress compared to the quantification of lipid peroxidation products.",0,1,0,0
"Elucidating Hepatocellular Oxidant Stress After Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury. Acute dysfunction of the liver, characterized by the release of hepatocellular enzymes into the bloodstream, a reduced rate of bile flow, and the sequestration of neutrophils within the liver, occurs upon reperfusion of an ischemic intestine. The precise pathophysiology of this acute hepatic damage remains to be fully understood. This investigation was conducted to ascertain whether oxidants are involved in the hepatic injury and to determine the relative utility of various indirect approaches for assessing oxidant exposure in living organisms. A standardized intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in rats. Hepatic tissue was subsequently examined for lipid peroxidation products and for both oxidized and reduced glutathione. Total glutathione levels in hepatic tissue remained unchanged following the intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Oxidized glutathione (GSSG) exhibited a statistically significant elevation after 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. In contrast, no increase was observed in any products of lipid peroxidation in conjunction with this injury. The rise in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion implies that hepatocytes are subjected to an oxidant stress. The absence of a substantial increase in lipid peroxidation products suggests that the oxidant stress is not intense enough to lead to irreversible damage to hepatocyte cell membranes. These data also indicate that measuring tissue GSSG may offer a more sensitive assessment of oxidant stress than the measurement of lipid peroxidation products.",0,1,0,0
"Characterization of Hepatocellular Oxidant Stress Following Intestinal Ischemia-Reperfusion. The reperfusion of ischemic intestine leads to acute liver dysfunction, manifesting as the release of hepatocellular enzymes into plasma, a decrease in bile flow rate, and the sequestration of neutrophils within the liver. The mechanisms underlying this acute hepatic injury are currently not fully understood. This study aimed to ascertain the role of oxidants in the hepatic injury and to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of several indirect methodologies for assessing in vivo oxidant exposure. Rats were subjected to a standardized model of intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. Hepatic tissue was subsequently assayed for lipid peroxidation products, as well as for oxidized and reduced glutathione. No alteration was observed in total hepatic tissue glutathione following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion injury. A significant increase in oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was detected after 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion. However, no elevation in any lipid peroxidation products was associated with this injury. The observed increase in GSSG within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion indicates the exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress. The absence of a notable increase in lipid peroxidation products suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to cause irreversible damage to hepatocyte cell membranes. These findings further imply that the quantification of tissue GSSG may represent a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than the measurement of lipid peroxidation products.",0,1,0,0
"5-Azacytidine's Enhancement of Carcinogen-Induced Initiation in Rat Liver. To investigate the hypothesis that DNA hypomethylation plays a significant role in the initiation of carcinogenesis, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) at 10 mg/kg, a DNA methylation inhibitor, was administered to rats during the DNA repair synthesis phase elicited by three carcinogens: benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg), and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). Initiated hepatocytes in the liver were quantified as gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci following a 2-week selection regimen involving dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene and a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The findings demonstrated that, with all three carcinogens, 5-AzC administration during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes, for instance, 10-20 foci/cm2 in rats treated with 5-AzC and a carcinogen, compared to 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats receiving only the carcinogen. Further, administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during 1,2-DMH-induced repair synthesis indicated that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue, confirming 5-AzC incorporation during repair synthesis. In the absence of a carcinogen, 5-AzC administered after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy, when its incorporation would be maximal, failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation alone may not be sufficient for initiation, perhaps necessitating two events: one caused by the carcinogen and a second involving DNA hypomethylation.",0,1,0,0
"Augmentation of Carcinogen-Driven Hepatic Initiation by 5-Azacytidine-Mediated DNA Hypomethylation in Rats. This study investigated the premise that DNA hypomethylation is crucial for the initiation of the carcinogenic process. Rats received 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, during the period of repair synthesis induced by benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg), and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). Initiated hepatocytes were subsequently quantified in the liver as gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci after a 2-week selection regimen comprising dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene alongside a necrogenic CCl4 dose. The results indicated a significant increase in the incidence of initiated hepatocytes across all three carcinogen groups when 5-AzC was co-administered during repair synthesis; specifically, 10-20 foci/cm2 were observed in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared to 3-5 foci/cm2 in those receiving only the carcinogen. The incorporation of 5-AzC during repair synthesis was further elucidated by administering [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during 1,2-DMH-induced repair synthesis, revealing that 0.019 mol % of DNA cytosine residues were replaced by the analogue. Notably, 5-AzC alone, administered after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (when incorporation would be maximal), did not induce any gamma-GT positive foci in the absence of a carcinogen. These findings imply that DNA hypomethylation in isolation may be insufficient for initiation, suggesting that a two-step mechanism, involving a carcinogen-induced event followed by DNA hypomethylation, may be required.",0,1,0,0
"Potentiation of Carcinogen-Induced Liver Initiation in Rats by 5-Azacytidine Administration. The study aimed to evaluate the role of DNA hypomethylation in the initiation of the carcinogenic process. To this end, 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), a DNA methylation inhibitor, was administered to rats during the DNA repair phase prompted by three specific carcinogens: benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg), and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). Initiated hepatocytes within the liver were measured via gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci, which formed following a 2-week selection regimen involving dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene and a necrogenic CCl4 dose. Results indicated a notable increase in the incidence of initiated hepatocytes with all three carcinogens when 5-AzC was given during repair synthesis, showing 10-20 foci/cm2 in co-treated rats compared to 3-5 foci/cm2 in carcinogen-only treated rats. Administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during 1,2-DMH-induced repair synthesis further substantiated the incorporation of the analogue, with 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA being substituted. Critically, in the absence of a carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (at a time of presumed maximum incorporation) failed to produce any gamma-GT positive foci. These findings propose that DNA hypomethylation per se is insufficient for initiation, suggesting that a two-event process, with an initial carcinogenic insult followed by DNA hypomethylation, may be necessary.",0,1,0,0
"5-Azacytidine-Mediated Hypomethylation Synergizes with Carcinogens to Promote Rat Hepatic Initiation. We tested the hypothesis that DNA hypomethylation plays an important role in the initiation of the carcinogenic process. 5-azacytidine (5-AzC) (10 mg/kg), an inhibitor of DNA methylation, was administered to rats during the repair synthesis phase induced by benzo[a]-pyrene (200 mg/kg), N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (60 mg/kg), and 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (1,2-DMH) (100 mg/kg). Initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assessed as gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) positive foci after a 2-week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02% 2-acetylaminofluorene coupled with a necrogenic dose of CCl4. The obtained results demonstrated that with all three carcinogens, administration of 5-AzC during repair synthesis significantly increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes; specifically, 10-20 foci/cm2 were observed in 5-AzC and carcinogen-treated rats compared with 3-5 foci/cm2 in rats treated solely with the carcinogen. Confirmation of 5-AzC incorporation during repair synthesis was provided by the administration of [3H]-5-azadeoxycytidine during 1,2-DMH-induced repair synthesis, which showed 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in DNA were substituted by the analogue. Crucially, in the absence of the carcinogen, 5-AzC given after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy (when its incorporation should be maximum) failed to induce any gamma-GT positive foci.

"An investigation into the contribution of p-aminophenol to acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity, examining bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate's impact on toxicity and metabolism in Fischer 344 rats. Acetaminophen (APAP) induces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats, with p-aminophenol (PAP), a known nephrotoxicant, identified as an APAP metabolite in this model. This study aimed to ascertain if PAP generation is essential for APAP-mediated nephrotoxicity. To achieve this, the influence of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on the nephrotoxicity and metabolic fate of both APAP and PAP was evaluated. BNPP, at concentrations from 1 to 8 mM, proportionally decreased APAP deacetylation and covalent binding within F344 renal cortical homogenates. Pre-administration of BNPP before APAP or PAP dosage led to a notable attenuation of APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity, yet PAP nephrotoxicity remained unaffected. This outcome was not attributable to altered pharmacokinetics of APAP or its acetylated derivatives in plasma or renal/hepatic tissues. Rather, BNPP pretreatment decreased the proportion of APAP excreted as PAP by 64% and 75% following APAP doses of 750 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg, respectively. BNPP did not modify the excretion of APAP or its non-deacetylated metabolites, nor did it alter the excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg. Consequently, the observed reduction in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity by BNPP appears to stem from its inhibition of APAP deacetylation. It is concluded that in vivo PAP formation contributes, at least partially, to APAP-induced renal tubular necrosis.",0,1,0,0
"Elucidating the contribution of p-aminophenol to acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: modulation by bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate in Fischer 344 rats. Acetaminophen (APAP) elicits proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats. Recent findings indicate that p-aminophenol (PAP), a potent nephrotoxic agent, is an APAP metabolite in these rats. The objective of this investigation was to determine whether PAP formation constitutes a prerequisite step in APAP-mediated renal damage. For this purpose, the impact of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on the nephrotoxic effects and metabolic processing of APAP and PAP was assessed. BNPP effectively reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration-dependent manner (1 to 8 mM). Administration of BNPP prior to APAP or PAP significantly diminished APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity, but had no effect on PAP nephrotoxicity. This outcome was not due to altered systemic or tissue distribution of APAP or its acetylated metabolites. Instead, BNPP pretreatment reduced the percentage of APAP eliminated as PAP by 64% and 75% following APAP administrations of 750 mg/kg and 900 mg/kg. BNPP did not affect the excretion patterns of APAP or its non-deacetylated metabolites, nor did it alter PAP or its metabolite excretion after PAP doses of 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg. Therefore, the decrease in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity observed with BNPP appears to result from its capacity to inhibit APAP deacetylation.

"The causal link of p-aminophenol in acetaminophen nephrotoxicity: intervention with bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on metabolism and toxicity in Fischer 344 rats. Proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 (F344) rats is caused by acetaminophen (APAP). P-aminophenol (PAP), a known potent nephrotoxicant, has recently been identified as an APAP metabolite in F344 rats. This study sought to establish if PAP generation is an obligatory step in APAP-induced nephrotoxicity. Consequently, the effects of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on the nephrotoxicity and metabolism of APAP and PAP were evaluated. BNPP (1 to 8 mM) dose-dependently decreased APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates. Pretreatment of animals with BNPP before APAP or PAP administration led to a substantial reduction in APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity, but not PAP nephrotoxicity. This finding was not attributable to changes in the disposition of APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue. Instead, BNPP pretreatment lowered the proportion of APAP excreted as PAP by 64% and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg/kg, respectively. BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any non-deacetylated metabolites, nor did BNPP modify the excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg/kg.

"Assessing p-aminophenol as a determinant of acetaminophen-induced nephrotoxicity: the influence of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate on toxicity and metabolic pathways in Fischer 344 rats.

P-aminophenol (PAP), a well-established potent nephrotoxicant, has recently been identified as an APAP metabolite in F344 rats.

Therefore, the impact of bis(p-nitrophenyl) phosphate (BNPP), an acylamidase inhibitor, on the nephrotoxicity and metabolism of both APAP and PAP was investigated. Within F344 renal cortical homogenates, BNPP (at 1 to 8 mM concentrations) produced a concentration-dependent decrease in APAP deacetylation and covalent binding. Administering BNPP prior to either APAP or PAP resulted in a significant decrease in APAP (900 mg/kg) nephrotoxicity, while PAP nephrotoxicity remained unaffected.

Phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive human genetic disorder, arises from a deficiency of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1). This common inborn error of amino-acid metabolism affects Caucasian populations, with approximately 1 in 50 individuals being carriers of a PKU allele. To elucidate the molecular foundation of PKU, we analyzed twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes of the PAH locus within the Northern European population, observing that 90% of PKU alleles in this group are restricted to four prevalent RFLP haplotypes. Our prior work identified a splicing mutation in the PAH gene linked to RFLP haplotype 3, accounting for about 40% of mutant alleles. This study now details the molecular defect associated with the RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect is a C-to-T transversion in exon 12, leading to an arginine-to-tryptophan (Arg to Trp) amino-acid substitution at PAH residue 408. Direct hybridization utilizing a specific oligonucleotide probe confirmed that this mutation is also in linkage disequilibrium with RFLP haplotype 2 alleles, which comprise approximately 20% of mutant PAH genes.",0,1,0,0
"Linkage Disequilibrium Between a Phenylketonuria-Associated Amino-Acid Substitution and DNA Haplotype 2. Phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder, is characterized by hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1.14.16.1) deficiency.

"Captopril's Ameliorative Effects on Pulmonary and Renal Dysfunction Induced by Intravascular Coagulation in Rats. Administering thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) to rats induces intravascular coagulation and fibrinolysis inhibition, leading to pulmonary and renal dysfunction akin to that observed in human trauma or sepsis. The administration of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was found to mitigate both pulmonary and renal dysfunction in this rodent model. Rats treated with Captopril exhibited reduced lung weights and enhanced arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2). Albumin levels in the lungs remained unchanged, indicating Captopril's lack of effect on protein extravasation. Captopril effectively prevented renal injury, evidenced by reductions in elevated serum urea and kidney weight. Furthermore, kidney fibrin content was substantially lower in Captopril-treated animals compared to those receiving only thrombin and AMCA. It is hypothesized that Captopril's pulmonary benefits stem from a vasodilatory action, mediated by decreased circulating Angiotensin II and increased prostacyclin (secondary to elevated bradykinin). Similarly, Captopril may reduce the thrombin-induced increase in glomerular filtration, thereby minimizing fibrin monomer aggregation in the glomeruli and consequently reducing fibrin deposition and kidney damage.",0,1,0,0
"Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition with Captopril on Intravascular Coagulation-Mediated Pulmonary and Renal Insufficiency in Rats. In rats, the induction of intravascular coagulation and subsequent inhibition of fibrinolysis via thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) injections results in pulmonary and renal insufficiency that mirrors conditions following trauma or sepsis in humans. Treatment with Captopril (1 mg/kg), an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lessened the severity of both pulmonary and renal insufficiency within this rat model. Among rats administered this enzyme-blocking agent, lung weights were lower, and PaO2 showed improvement. The albumin content within the lungs was unaffected, suggesting Captopril did not influence protein extravasation. Captopril prevented renal damage, which was indicated by a decrease in elevated serum urea and reduced kidney weight. The quantity of fibrin in the kidneys was also notably lower than in animals given only thrombin and AMCA. It is proposed that Captopril's impact on the lungs might be due to a vasodilatory effect, resulting from a reduction in circulating Angiotensin II and an elevation in prostacyclin (attributable to an increase in bradykinin). Captopril may, through the same mechanism, attenuate the increased glomerular filtration known to occur after thrombin injection, thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli and leading to reduced fibrin deposition and subsequent kidney damage.",0,1,0,0
"Mitigation of Intravascular Coagulation-Induced Pulmonary and Renal Failure in Rats by Captopril, an ACE Inhibitor. Intravascular coagulation, coupled with fibrinolysis inhibition, induced in rats by thrombin and tranexamic acid (AMCA) administration, precipitates pulmonary and renal failure resembling conditions observed after human trauma or sepsis. A single dose of Captopril (1 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, was found to decrease both pulmonary and renal failure in this experimental rat model. Treated rats exhibited diminished lung weights and improved arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2). Lung albumin levels remained constant, signifying that Captopril did not affect protein leakage. Renal injury, characterized by elevated serum urea and increased kidney weight, was averted by Captopril. Furthermore, the amount of fibrin detected in the kidneys was considerably less than in control animals receiving thrombin and AMCA only. The beneficial pulmonary effects of Captopril are suggested to arise from a vasodilatory action, mediated by a decrease in circulating Angiotensin II and a rise in prostacyclin (consequent to increased bradykinin). Captopril may similarly reduce the known thrombin-induced increase in glomerular filtration, thereby curtailing the aggregation of fibrin monomers within the glomeruli, which would lead to less fibrin deposition and, consequently, reduced kidney damage.",0,1,0,0
"Captopril's Efficacy Against Pulmonary and Renal Insufficiency Arising from Intravascular Coagulation in a Rat Model.

In this rat model, Captopril (1 mg/kg), an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, significantly reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency. Animals receiving this enzyme-blocking agent demonstrated lower lung weights and improved PaO2. Lung albumin content remained unchanged, indicating Captopril did not impact protein extravasation. Captopril prevented renal damage, as evidenced by a reduction in elevated serum urea and kidney weight. The quantity of fibrin within the kidneys was also substantially less compared to rats given thrombin and AMCA alone. We propose that Captopril's effects on the lungs are likely due to a vasodilatory mechanism, involving a decrease in circulating Angiotensin II and an increase in prostacyclin (mediated by elevated bradykinin). Captopril might also, through this same mechanism, mitigate the rise in glomerular filtration known to occur after thrombin administration, thus diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli and resulting in less fibrin deposition and subsequent reduction in kidney injury.",0,1,0,0

"Prevalence of YMDD motif mutations among lamivudine-naive Iranian patients with chronic hepatitis B. Lamivudine is a standard treatment for chronic hepatitis B patients. Prior research indicates that YMDD motif mutants, representing lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus, can arise as inherent genomic variations in chronic hepatitis B patients not receiving lamivudine. This study's objective was to ascertain the prevalence of these YMDD motif mutations in lamivudine-untreated chronic hepatitis B patients within Iran. The investigation enrolled 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had no history of lamivudine therapy.

"Etiology of Acute Thrombotic Microangiopathy in Renal Transplant Recipients. The occurrence of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is a recognized complication in individuals undergoing renal transplantation, frequently manifesting as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study aimed to identify the etiologies of TMA within a cohort of kidney transplant recipients and to contextualize these findings with existing literature. A retrospective analysis of 25 transplant biopsies performed at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between June 2003 and June 2004, was conducted to investigate TMA causes. Pre- and post-transplant crossmatching was performed when feasible. Five cases of TMA were identified. Of these, three originated from the 25 transplantations performed at the study institution, while two involved patients referred for follow-up after receiving transplants abroad. Etiologically, three cases were linked to cyclosporine, and one case involved both cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case exhibited characteristics of TMA associated with antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. Literature indicates that recurrent HUS is the most common cause of post-transplant HUS, with drug-induced toxicity (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), procoagulant states, and antibody-mediated rejection also contributing.

"Investigation into Acute Thrombotic Microangiopathy Etiologies Following Renal Transplantation. A common issue for patients after renal transplantation is thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), frequently presenting as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The current study aimed to delineate the etiologies of TMA in recipients of renal transplants and to critically engage with the existing scientific literature. Between June 2003 and June 2004, an inquiry was conducted at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, by scrutinizing the slides from all 25 transplant biopsies performed during this twelve-month period to identify TMA causes. Pre- and post-transplant crossmatching procedures were undertaken whenever feasible. The investigation identified five cases of TMA. Of these, three cases arose from the 25 transplantations performed at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital, whereas two other cases involved patients whose transplantations were performed abroad, referred for subsequent care. Cyclosporine was implicated in three cases, and one case was attributed to the combined effect of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The final case manifested features of TMA associated with an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. According to published literature, recurrence of HUS stands as the most prevalent cause of HUS in post-transplant patients, with other contributing factors including drug-related toxicity (cyclosporine, tacrolimus), hypercoagulable states, and antibody-mediated rejection.

"Determinants of Acute Thrombotic Microangiopathy in Kidney Transplant Recipients. Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) represents a well-established complication in patients who have undergone renal transplantation, often observed as a manifestation of hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). This study's objective was to ascertain the specific determinants of TMA among renal transplant recipients and to provide a discussion informed by the scientific literature. To achieve this, a review of 25 transplant biopsy slides conducted over a one-year period, from June 2003 to June 2004, at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, was undertaken to identify the underlying causes of TMA. Where possible, pre- and post-transplant crossmatching data were also considered. A total of five TMA cases were uncovered. Three of these cases originated from the 25 transplantations performed at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital, while the remaining two cases involved patients who received transplants internationally and were referred for follow-up. Concerning the identified causes, three cases were linked to cyclosporine, and one case was attributed to the concurrent administration of cyclosporine and tacrolimus. The fifth case presented with TMA characteristics consistent with an antiphospholipid syndrome in an individual suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus. Literature findings indicate that recurrence of HUS is the most prevalent etiology of HUS in individuals post-renal transplantation, with additional causes encompassing drug-induced toxicity (e.g., cyclosporine, tacrolimus), hypercoagulable conditions, and rejection mediated by antibodies. Within the scope of this study, drug-related factors, predominantly cyclosporine, were identified as the most common cause of TMA. The incidence of TMA in this study, at 20%, corresponded to the percentages documented in published research.",0,1,0,0

"Efficacy of intramuscular hepatitis B immune globulin and lamivudine combination therapy for preventing hepatitis B recurrence post-liver transplantation. The combined administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIg) and lamivudine has significantly enhanced the survival of HBsAg-positive patients following liver transplantation by preventing hepatitis B recurrence. This investigation sought to assess the outcomes of liver transplantation in patients afflicted with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Through a retrospective analysis of patient charts and an organ transplant database, 51 individuals (43 males, 8 females) who underwent transplantation for benign HBV-related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 and survived beyond three months were identified. HBIg was initially administered intravenously for the first week, followed by intramuscular delivery thereafter. Over a median follow-up period of 14.1 months, the total recurrence rate among the 51 patients was 3.9% (2/51). Patient survival rates were 88.3% at one year and 82.4% at two years, respectively. Among 10 patients receiving a 100 mg daily oral dose of lamivudine for two weeks prior to transplantation, seroconversion was observed in 57.1% (4/7) of HBV-DNA positive patients and 62.5% (5/8) of HBeAg positive patients, rendering them negative.

"Comparative Acute Renal Toxicity of Doxorubicin-Loaded Cyanoacrylate Nanoparticles and Free Doxorubicin. This study investigated the acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (DXNP) in both healthy rats and those with experimental glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, free doxorubicin (DX) (5 mg/kg) resulted in 2/6 fatalities within one week, while all control animals, free nanoparticles (NP), and DXNP-treated rats survived. Proteinuria was threefold higher in DXNP-treated animals compared to DX-treated ones, with free NP causing no proteinuria. Kidneys showed 2.7 times greater DXNP concentration than free DX two hours post-injection (p < 0.025). Among rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis, 5/6 DX-treated rats died within seven days, whereas all animals receiving DXNP, NP, or no treatment survived. Proteinuria manifested in all groups, but was 2-5 times more severe (p > 0.001) and extended after doxorubicin administration (400-700 mg/day), without a significant difference between DXNP and DX. Unloaded NP treatment mirrored control group behavior. These findings indicate that, under the experimental conditions described, DXNP led to fewer animal deaths than free DX, notwithstanding its heightened renal toxicity. Both improved survival and the observed nephrosis are most plausibly linked to increased uptake of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.",0,1,0,0
"Renal Disposition and Acute Toxicity of Doxorubicin-Loaded Cyanoacrylate Nanoparticles. The acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (DXNP) was assessed in both healthy rats and those afflicted with experimental glomerulonephritis. Among normal rats, a single dose of free doxorubicin (DX) (5 mg/kg) caused the death of 2 out of 6 animals within seven days, contrasting with the complete survival of control animals and those given either free nanoparticles (NP) or DXNP. Animals treated with DXNP exhibited proteinuria that was three times greater than in those receiving DX, while free NP elicited no proteinuria. At two hours post-administration, DXNP accumulated in kidneys at a concentration 2.7 times higher than free DX (p < 0.025). In rats with immune-mediated experimental glomerulonephritis, 5 out of 6 DX-treated rats perished within seven days, unlike those treated with DXNP, NP, or untreated controls, all of whom survived. While proteinuria developed across all series, it was 2 to 5 times more intense (p > 0.001) and prolonged following doxorubicin treatment (400-700 mg/day), with no statistically significant difference between DXNP and DX groups. Rats administered unloaded NP exhibited behavior consistent with controls. The present data demonstrate that, within these experimental parameters, DXNP caused fewer mortalities than free DX, despite manifesting increased renal toxicity. Both these observations—enhanced survival and nephrosis—are likely attributable to an augmented cellular capture of DXNP by components of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.",0,1,0,0
"Elevated Renal Toxicity of Doxorubicin-Loaded Cyanoacrylate Nanoparticles Despite Improved Survival. This investigation aimed to characterize the acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin-loaded nanoparticles (DXNP) in healthy rats and those with induced glomerulonephritis. In normal rats, free doxorubicin (DX) at 5 mg/kg resulted in 2 of 6 deaths within one week, whereas all control animals, free nanoparticles (NP), and DXNP recipients survived. A three-fold increase in proteinuria was observed in DXNP-treated animals compared to DX-treated counterparts, with free NP administration eliciting no proteinuria. Kidney concentration of DXNP was 2.7 times higher than free DX two hours after injection (p < 0.025). Within the immune experimental glomerulonephritis model, 5 of 6 DX-treated rats died within 7 days, a stark contrast to the survival of all animals receiving DXNP, NP, or no intervention. Proteinuria manifested in all series, but was between 2 and 5 times more pronounced (p > 0.001) and extended after doxorubicin therapy (400-700 mg/day), with no significant distinction between DXNP and DX. Rats receiving unloaded NP behaved identically to controls. These findings indicate that, under the experimental conditions, DXNP resulted in fewer animal fatalities than free DX, even though it exhibited heightened renal toxicity. The dual outcomes of enhanced survival and nephrosis are most probably linked to the augmented uptake of DXNP by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system, including mesangial cells.",0,1,0,0

"Potentiation of Aminonucleoside Nephrosis by Protamine Co-administration. An experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) was established in rats through the concurrent administration of puromycin-aminonucleoside (AMNS) and protamine sulfate (PS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, which had undergone uninephrectomy three weeks prior, received daily subcutaneous injections of AMNS (1 mg/100 g body weight) and intravenous PS (two distinct doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body weight) over a four-day period. This injection regimen was subsequently repeated three more times at 10-day intervals. Animals were euthanized on days 24, 52, and 80. They exhibited the development of nephrotic syndrome, ultimately progressing to renal failure. The trajectory of creatinine clearance demonstrated a decline, showing a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) compared to control groups treated with AMNS alone, PS alone, or saline. Glomerular examination revealed alterations characteristic of progressive FSGS. Initial ultrastructural investigations indicated a significant deficit of perfused ruthenium red particles on the lamina rara externa and pronounced modifications within the epithelial cell cytoplasm. These findings suggest that the co-administration of PS intensifies the glomerular toxicity of AMNS, thereby facilitating the rapid onset of progressive FSGS in rats, culminating in end-stage renal disease.",0,1,0,0
"Augmented Aminonucleoside Nephrosis through Concurrent Protamine Administration. A rat model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis (FSGS) was developed by the simultaneous provision of puromycin-aminonucleoside (AMNS) and protamine sulfate (PS). Male Sprague-Dawley rats, having undergone uninephrectomy three weeks beforehand, were administered daily subcutaneous AMNS (1 mg/100 g body weight) and intravenous PS (two separate doses of 2.5 mg/100 g body weight) for four consecutive days. This injection series was replicated three additional times at 10-day intervals. Euthanasia of the animals occurred on days 24, 52, and 80. The animals manifested nephrotic syndrome and eventually renal failure. The creatinine clearance time-course curve exhibited a reduction and a significant disparity (P < 0.01) when compared to each control cohort, including those receiving only AMNS, only PS, or saline. Their glomeruli displayed features consistent with progressive FSGS. Early ultrastructural analysis unveiled a substantial absence of perfused ruthenium red particles on the lamina rara externa and notable changes in the epithelial cell cytoplasm. Consequently, it is proposed that PS administration exacerbates the toxic effects of AMNS on the glomerulus, leading to the prompt induction of progressive FSGS in rats, ultimately resulting in end-stage renal disease.",0,1,0,0

This injection sequence was repeated on three subsequent occasions, with 10-day intervals between series. The animals were humanely sacrificed on days 24, 52, and 80. They progressed to develop nephrotic syndrome and, ultimately, renal failure. The time-dependent decrease in creatinine clearance was statistically significant (P < 0.01) when contrasted with individual control groups administered AMNS alone, PS alone, or saline. Histopathological examination of their glomeruli revealed characteristics of progressive FSGS. Initial ultrastructural assessments indicated a notable scarcity of perfused ruthenium red particles on the lamina rara externa and pronounced alterations within the epithelial cell cytoplasm.

"Identification of a Novel Nonsense Mutation in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene (Haplotype 4) in Eastern European Phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited condition resulting from a deficiency in hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Numerous mutations in the PAH gene have been documented, revealing linkage disequilibrium between RFLP haplotypes and specific mutations. A previously uncharacterized molecular lesion was detected in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient through direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA. This C-to-T transition leads to the substitution of Arg243 with a termination codon, and the mutated allele is linked to haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. The mutation is observed in two out of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles in Eastern European populations but is absent in Western European and Asian populations. The low frequency of this mutant allele and its limited geographical range imply a recent mutational event on a normal haplotype 4 background within Eastern Europe.",0,1,0,0
"Discovery of a Nonsense Mutation within the PAH Gene (Haplotype 4-Associated) in Eastern European Phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria (PKU) arises from an inherited deficit of hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Previous research has detailed several mutations within the PAH gene, establishing linkage disequilibrium between RFLP haplotypes and specific genetic alterations. Using direct sequencing of PCR-amplified DNA, a novel molecular defect was uncovered in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian individual with PKU. This specific C-to-T transition results in the replacement of Arginine at position 243 with a stop codon, and this variant allele correlates with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. Data indicate its presence in two of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among individuals from Eastern Europe, while it is not detected in those from Western Europe or Asia. The infrequency of this allele and its geographically restricted presence suggest that this mutational event emerged recently on a wild-type haplotype 4 background within Eastern Europe.",0,1,0,0
"Characterization of a Haplotype 4-Linked Nonsense Mutation in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene in Eastern European Phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by insufficient hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) activity. Multiple mutations in the PAH gene have been previously documented, demonstrating a relationship of linkage disequilibrium between RFLP haplotypes and particular mutations. A novel genetic alteration was identified in exon 7 of the PAH gene in a Hungarian PKU patient. This discovery was made through direct sequencing of DNA amplified via PCR. The mutation involves a C-to-T transition, which leads to the substitution of Arginine at position 243 with a premature termination codon. This mutated allele is specifically associated with haplotype 4 of the PAH gene. Its prevalence is recorded as two out of nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern European individuals, yet it is entirely absent in populations from Western Europe and Asia.

"Evaluation of Perinatal Hepatitis B and Rubella Prevention Practices in New Hampshire Hospitals. This study aimed to assess the adherence to recommended perinatal hepatitis B and rubella prevention protocols within New Hampshire. Data were meticulously extracted from 2,021 paired mother-infant records, focusing on the 2000 birth cohort across the state's 25 delivery hospitals. The evaluation encompassed prenatal screening for both hepatitis B and rubella, the administration of the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose to all infants, the provision of hepatitis B immune globulin to infants of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers, rubella immunity status, and in-hospital postpartum rubella vaccine uptake among nonimmune women. Key findings indicated high prenatal screening rates for hepatitis B (98.8%) and rubella (99.4%). While 76.2% of all infants received the hepatitis B vaccine birth dose, all infants born to hepatitis B surface antigen-positive mothers were administered hepatitis B immune globulin. Multivariate logistic regression identified the month of delivery and infant birth weight as independent predictors for hepatitis B vaccination, with significantly lower rates in January (48.5%) and February (67.5%) 2000 compared to other months, and the highest in December 2000 (88.2%).

"The Common Genetic Root of Phenylketonuria among Yemenite Jews. Phenylketonuria (PKU), an inherited metabolic disorder, arises from recessive mutations in the gene encoding hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Its global incidence varies significantly, reaching its highest rates (approximately 1 in 5,000 live births) in populations such as Yemenite Jews, and also in Ireland and western Scotland. While numerous point mutations typically account for most PKU cases in European populations, this study identifies a single molecular defect—specifically, a deletion spanning the third exon of the PAH gene—as the sole cause of PKU among Yemenite Jews. Molecular screening of a random sample from this community revealed a high frequency of carriers for this defective gene. Furthermore, despite tracing the deleted PAH gene to 25 distinct locations across Yemen, family histories and official documents of the Yemenite Jewish community indicate that the common ancestor of all carriers of this genetic defect lived in Sana, the capital of Yemen, prior to the eighteenth century.",0,1,0,0
"Molecular Basis and Ancestral Linkage of Phenylketonuria in Yemenite Jews. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a metabolic disease resulting from recessive mutations in the gene responsible for producing the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The prevalence of PKU shows considerable variation across different geographical regions, with the highest rates (around 1 in 5,000 live births) observed in groups like Yemenite Jews, and also in Ireland and western Scotland. In contrast to the European population, where various point mutations are commonly found, we report that a specific molecular anomaly—a deletion encompassing the third exon of the PAH gene—is exclusively responsible for all PKU cases within the Yemenite Jewish community. Examination of a random sample of Yemenite Jews using a molecular probe designed to detect carriers of this deletion indicated a substantial frequency of the altered gene within this population. Although the deleted PAH gene was identified in 25 different locations throughout Yemen, historical records and family lineages of the Yemenite Jewish community establish that the common ancestor of all individuals carrying this genetic defect resided in Sana, Yemen’s capital, before the eighteenth century.",0,1,0,0
"Etiology and Historical Tracing of Phenylketonuria in the Yemenite Jewish Population. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) in the liver. The incidence of PKU varies widely worldwide, being particularly high (approximately 1 in 5,000 live births) among Yemenite Jews, as well as in Ireland and western Scotland. Most PKU cases in the European population are attributable to a limited number of distinct point mutations. Here, we demonstrate that a single molecular defect—a deletion affecting the third exon of the PAH gene—is the underlying cause for every PKU case among Yemenite Jews. A molecular probe designed to identify carriers of this deletion, when applied to a random sample of Yemenite Jews, revealed a high frequency of the defective gene in this community.

Lymphocyte activities were determined to be 33–39% for the mother, 11–29% for the father, 82–103% for the brother, and 38–48% for the sister, relative to the lowest normal reference value. Correspondingly, fibroblasts obtained from the patient's mother and father demonstrated activities of 42% and 34%, respectively, against the lowest normal range. These collective data establish that the condition is transmitted through autosomal recessive inheritance and confirm the efficacy of employing lymphocytes and fibroblasts for the identification of carriers. A 21-hour fasting period had no observed effect on increasing pyruvate carboxylase or mitochondrial PEPCK activity in lymphocytes.",0,1,0,0
"Characterizing Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency Carrier Status Through Lymphocyte and Fibroblast Assays. Pyruvate carboxylase (E.C. 6.4.1.1) activity was evaluated in the circulating peripheral lymphocytes and cultured skin fibroblasts of a family whose proband presented with hepatic, cerebral, renal cortical, leukocyte, and fibroblast pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (PC Portland deficiency). Within lymphocytes, activity levels were measured as 33–39% for the mother, 11–29% for the father, 82–103% for the brother, and 38–48% for the sister, each relative to the lowest normal activity.

"The Impact of Glyceryl Trinitrate on Sphincter of Oddi Spasm Induced by Prostigmine-Morphine. This investigation aimed to assess the influence of glyceryl trinitrate on prostigmine-morphine-elicited sphincter of Oddi spasm in nine female patients diagnosed with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. The methodology involved inducing sphincter of Oddi spasm via the administration of 0.5 mg intramuscular prostigmine and 10 mg subcutaneous morphine, with visualization achieved through quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire experimental protocol was then reiterated during a continuous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (Nitrolingual at 1 µg/kg/min for 120 minutes). Prostigmine-morphine challenge resulted in notable elevations in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 ± 5.05 versus 22.77 ± 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 ± 5.99 versus 40.0 ± 2.88), as well as in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 ± 16.01 versus 27.37 ± 2.19), HH (117.61 ± 14.71 versus 31.85 ± 3.99), and CBD (158.11 ± 9.18 versus 40.1 ± 6.24), indicative of a complete sphincter of Oddi spasm.

"Glyceryl Trinitrate's Efficacy Against Sphincter of Oddi Spasm Triggered by Prostigmine-Morphine. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of glyceryl trinitrate in alleviating sphincter of Oddi spasm induced by prostigmine-morphine in nine female patients suffering from sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. The methodology involved inducing sphincter of Oddi spasm using a combination of 0.5 mg intramuscular prostigmine and 10 mg subcutaneous morphine, with real-time visualization accomplished via quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. The entire experimental sequence was repeated during a continuous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate, administered as Nitrolingual at a rate of 1 µg/kg/min over 120 minutes. Results demonstrated that prostigmine-morphine provocation led to significant increases in the time to peak activity (Tmax) for the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 ± 5.05 vs. 22.77 ± 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 ± 5.99 vs. 40.0 ± 2.88), and in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) for the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 ± 16.01 vs. 27.37 ± 2.19), HH (117.61 ± 14.71 vs. 31.85 ± 3.99), and CBD (158.11 ± 9.18 vs. 40.1 ± 6.24), indicative of a severe sphincter of Oddi spasm.

"Modulation of Prostigmine-Morphine-Induced Sphincter of Oddi Spasm by Glyceryl Trinitrate. This study sought to evaluate how glyceryl trinitrate modulates sphincter of Oddi spasm, which was pharmacologically induced by prostigmine-morphine, in a cohort of nine female patients presenting with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. The methodology involved the induction of sphincter of Oddi spasm through combined prostigmine (0.5 mg intramuscularly) and morphine (10 mg subcutaneously) administration, with its progression monitored via quantitative hepatobiliary scintigraphy. This entire sequence was then replicated while subjects received a continuous glyceryl trinitrate infusion (Nitrolingual, 1 µg/kg/min over 120 minutes). Prostigmine-morphine challenge significantly elevated the time to peak activity (Tmax) in the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 ± 5.05 versus 22.77 ± 3.26) and common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 ± 5.99 versus 40.0 ± 2.88), alongside increases in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) for the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 ± 16.01 versus 27.37 ± 2.19), HH (117.61 ± 14.71 versus 31.85 ± 3.99), and CBD (158.11 ± 9.18 versus 40.1 ± 6.24), confirming complete sphincter of Oddi spasm. Remarkably, glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely counteracted these prostigmine-morphine-elicited changes in quantitative parameters (Tmax over LP: 11.33 ± 1.13; HH: 18.88 ± 1.48; CBD: 36.22 ± 1.92; and T1/2 over LP: 28.21 ± 1.83; HH: 33.42 ± 3.10; CBD: 41.66 ± 6.33), underscoring its effective sphincter-relaxing properties. These findings constitute the first human demonstration of glyceryl trinitrate's effectiveness in resolving morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm.

"Glyceryl Trinitrate's Reversal of Prostigmine-Morphine-Evoked Sphincter of Oddi Spasm. The current investigation was designed to determine the capacity of glyceryl trinitrate to counteract prostigmine-morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm in a cohort of nine female patients diagnosed with sphincter of Oddi dyskinesia. The methodology involved inducing sphincter of Oddi spasm by administering 0.5 mg prostigmine intramuscularly and 10 mg morphine subcutaneously, which was subsequently visualized and quantified using hepatobiliary scintigraphy. This entire experimental procedure was then replicated during a continuous intravenous infusion of glyceryl trinitrate (Nitrolingual, 1 µg/kg/min for 120 minutes). Prostigmine-morphine challenge consistently resulted in statistically significant elevations in the time to peak activity (Tmax) over the hepatic hilum (HH: 34.33 ± 5.05 compared to 22.77 ± 3.26) and the common bile duct (CBD: 60.44 ± 5.99 compared to 40.0 ± 2.88), as well as in the half-time of excretion (T1/2) over the liver parenchyma (LP: 120.04 ± 16.01 compared to 27.37 ± 2.19), HH (117.61 ± 14.71 compared to 31.85 ± 3.99), and CBD (158.11 ± 9.18 compared to 40.1 ± 6.24), thus confirming a complete spasm at the sphincter of Oddi level. Crucially, glyceryl trinitrate infusion completely restored the prostigmine-morphine-induced deviations in these quantitative parameters to baseline levels (Tmax over LP: 11.33 ± 1.13; HH: 18.88 ± 1.48; CBD: 36.22 ± 1.92; and T1/2 over LP: 28.21 ± 1.83; HH: 33.42 ± 3.10; CBD: 41.66 ± 6.33), thereby demonstrating its effective relaxant action on the sphincter. These results offer the inaugural human evidence of glyceryl trinitrate's efficacy in addressing morphine-induced sphincter of Oddi spasm.

"Identification of a Myogenic Transcription Program Activated by the PAX3-FKHR Fusion Oncogene Using cDNA Microarrays. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive pediatric cancer affecting striated muscle, is characterized in 60% of instances by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation. This genetic event leads to the fusion of PAX3, a developmental transcription factor crucial for limb myogenesis, with FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. While the resulting PAX3-FKHR gene exhibits transforming capabilities, its impact on gene expression remains largely undefined. To explore the actions of these transcription factors, both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells, followed by analysis of gene expression changes using a murine cDNA microarray comprising 2,225 elements. Our investigation revealed that PAX3-FKHR, but not PAX3, initiated a myogenic transcription program, encompassing the upregulation of transcription factors such as MyoD, Myogenin, Six1, and Slug, alongside numerous genes pertinent to various aspects of muscle function. Among these, the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5 were particularly noteworthy. The relevance of this model was supported by the confirmation that three of these genes (IGFBP5, HSIX1, and Slug) were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. This research employed cDNA microarrays to elucidate the gene expression pattern induced by an oncogenic transcription factor and underscores the significant myogenic characteristics of PAX3-FKHR within NIH 3T3 cells.",0,0,0,1
"cDNA Microarray Revelation of Myogenic Transcription Program Activation by the PAX3-FKHR Fusion Oncogene. Characterized by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation in 60% of cases, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma represents an aggressive pediatric cancer of striated muscle. This translocation results in the fusion of PAX3, a transcription factor essential for limb myogenesis during development, with FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. Although the resultant PAX3-FKHR gene possesses oncogenic properties, its influence on gene expression has largely been unexplored. To investigate the effects of these transcription factors, Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells, and subsequent gene expression alterations were assessed using a murine cDNA microarray containing 2,225 elements. We discovered that PAX3-FKHR, unlike PAX3, activated a myogenic transcription program. This program included the induction of transcription factors such as MyoD, Myogenin, Six1, and Slug, in addition to a suite of genes implicated in various facets of muscle function. Notably, this group featured the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5. The congruence of this model was indicated by the validation that IGFBP5, HSIX1, and Slug were also expressed in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.

"Demonstration of Myogenic Transcription Program Activation by the PAX3-FKHR Fusion Oncogene through cDNA Microarray Analysis. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, an aggressive pediatric striated muscle malignancy, is distinguished in 60% of cases by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation. This chromosomal rearrangement yields the fusion of PAX3, a developmental transcription factor indispensable for limb myogenesis, with FKHR, a forkhead family transcription factor. The emergent PAX3-FKHR gene exhibits transforming attributes; however, the transcriptional consequences of this chimeric oncogene are largely unknown. To analyze the functions of these transcription factors, both Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells, and the resultant changes in gene expression were scrutinised using a murine cDNA microarray comprising 2,225 elements. We observed that PAX3-FKHR, but not Pax3, instigated a myogenic transcription program, which involved the induction of transcription factors MyoD, Myogenin, Six1, and Slug, along with a collection of genes involved in diverse aspects of muscle function. Prominently among these were the growth factor gene Igf2 and its binding protein Igfbp5. The pertinence of this cellular model was supported by the verification that three of these genes (IGFBP5, HSIX1, and Slug) were also expressed in established alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines.

The aggressive pediatric striated muscle cancer, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, is characterized by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation in 60% of cases. This event leads to the fusion of PAX3, a developmental transcription factor critical for limb myogenesis, with FKHR, a member of the forkhead family of transcription factors. While the resulting PAX3-FKHR gene possesses transforming capabilities, its effects on overall gene expression patterns have remained largely uncharacterized. To probe the activities of these transcription factors, Pax3 and PAX3-FKHR were introduced into NIH 3T3 cells, and the resulting gene expression alterations were subsequently analyzed using a murine cDNA microarray containing 2,225 elements. Our findings indicated that PAX3-FKHR, in contrast to PAX3, activated a myogenic transcription program. This program included the upregulation of transcription factors MyoD, Myogenin, Six1, and Slug, as well as a range of genes contributing to various facets of muscle function.

"Orbital Adhesion and Ocular Motility Impairment Following Subtenon Carboplatin for Retinoblastoma. The background notes the recent use of focal subtenon carboplatin injections as a presumably benign adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. This study aimed to document our clinical observations of compromised ocular motility in patients who received subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. Abnormal ocular motility was identified in 10 consecutive retinoblastoma patients treated with subtenon carboplatin. Under general anesthesia, ocular manipulation and forced duction testing were performed, comparing motility post-tumor control with that at diagnosis. Histological analysis was conducted on eyes subsequently enucleated due to treatment failure (n = 4). All 12 eyes across the 10 patients, who received 1 to 6 subtenon carboplatin injections as part of multimodality therapy for intraocular retinoblastoma, exhibited limited ocular motility. Histopathology of one eye revealed numerous lipophages in the periorbital fat adjacent to the optic nerve, indicating phagocytosis of prior fat cells and suggesting preceding fat necrosis. Enucleations proved technically challenging and posed a risk of globe rupture due to extensive orbital soft tissue adhesions. In conclusion, subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is linked to substantial orbital soft tissue fibrosis, resulting in mechanical limitation of eye movements and complicating subsequent enucleation procedures. Consequently, subtenon carboplatin is not devoid of toxicity and should be reserved for specific clinical scenarios.",0,0,0,1
"Adverse Ocular Motility Outcomes Associated with Subtenon Carboplatin for Retinoblastoma Treatment. Subtenon carboplatin injections have recently been adopted as a supposedly non-toxic complement to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. Our objective was to report clinical findings concerning abnormal ocular motility in patients receiving this chemotherapy. Abnormal ocular motility was observed in 10 consecutive retinoblastoma patients who had undergone subtenon carboplatin treatment. During general anesthesia, eyes were assessed via forced duction testing, comparing motility after tumor resolution to that at initial diagnosis. Four eyes enucleated due to treatment failure underwent histological examination. All 12 eyes of the 10 patients, who received 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of their multimodality therapy for intraocular retinoblastoma, demonstrated restricted ocular movement. Histopathological evaluation of one enucleated eye revealed abundant lipophages in the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve, suggesting phagocytosis of pre-existing fat cells and prior fat necrosis. Enucleation surgeries were technically difficult and carried a high risk of globe rupture due to widespread orbital soft tissue adhesions. We conclude that subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy leads to significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, which mechanically restricts eye movements and complicates subsequent enucleation.

"Unanticipated Ocular Toxicity and Motility Dysfunction Following Subtenon Carboplatin in Retinoblastoma. The recent adoption of focal subtenon carboplatin injections as a purportedly toxicity-free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma formed the background of this investigation. The study's aim was to document our clinical observations regarding anomalous ocular motility in patients treated with subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy. Anomalous ocular motility was identified in a series of 10 consecutive retinoblastoma patients who had received subtenon carboplatin. Under general anesthesia, eyes were evaluated using forced duction testing, with ocular motility post-tumor control compared against motility at diagnosis. Histological assessment was performed on the four eyes subsequently enucleated due to therapeutic failure. Across all 10 patients, 12 eyes, which had received between 1 and 6 subtenon carboplatin injections as part of their combined therapeutic regimen for intraocular retinoblastoma, displayed compromised ocular motility. Histopathological examination of one eye revealed a high concentration of lipophages within the periorbital fat surrounding the optic nerve, suggesting the phagocytosis of existing fat cells and preceding fat necrosis. Enucleation procedures proved challenging and carried an elevated risk of globe rupture, attributable to extensive adhesions within the orbital soft tissues. This study concludes that subtenon carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with pronounced fibrosis of orbital soft tissues, which impedes eye movements mechanically and renders subsequent enucleation procedures arduous. Consequently, subtenon carboplatin is not without adverse effects, and its use should be limited to clearly defined indications.",0,0,0,1

We noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive retinoblastoma patients who had received subtenon carboplatin. During ocular manipulation under general anesthesia, eyes were assessed using forced duction testing, comparing motility after tumor control with motility at diagnosis.

Limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of the 10 patients who received 1 to 6 injections of subtenon carboplatin as part of their multimodality therapy for intraocular retinoblastoma. Histopathological examination of one eye revealed numerous lipophages in the periorbital fat around the optic nerve, indicating phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necrosis.

"Attenuation of diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis by concurrent phenobarbital administration in rats. This investigation aimed to clarify the impact of phenobarbital (PB), at an ingested dose of 15 mg per rat, on carcinogenesis when co-administered with diethylnitrosamine (DEN, 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats (180 g) were subjected to treatment with DEN only or with DEN + PB for periods of 2, 4, and 6 weeks, following an established hepatocarcinogenesis protocol. Following the completion of treatment, a significant reduction in the quantity and dimensions of induced PAS-positive preneoplastic foci was observed when PB was concurrently given with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The suppression of mitosis and formation of micronuclei, typically noted after partial hepatectomy in DEN-exposed rats, were also substantially diminished in the DEN + PB treated group. For the 2-week treatment duration, PB's presence did not significantly alter these latter parameters. In rats receiving DEN + PB, both survival was extended and tumor incidence was lowered compared to results from DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, known to promote carcinogenesis when administered sequentially after DEN, mitigates the carcinogen's impact when given alongside it. This 'anti-carcinogen' action influences both the initiation and promotion phases of precancerous lesions.

"Inhibitory effect of phenobarbital on diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis when co-administered in rats. The objective of this study was to elucidate the influence of phenobarbital (PB), administered at an ingested dose of 15 mg per rat, on the carcinogenic process when delivered simultaneously with diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats weighing 180 g were exposed to either DEN alone or DEN combined with PB for durations of 2, 4, and 6 weeks, adhering to our established schedule for hepatic carcinogenesis. Post-treatment, a notable decrease in both the number and size of induced PAS-positive preneoplastic foci was evident when PB was provided concurrently with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. Furthermore, the mitotic inhibition and the generation of micronuclei, typically observed following partial hepatectomy in DEN-treated animals, were significantly reduced in rats treated with DEN + PB. Conversely, when the treatment lasted only 2 weeks, PB's presence did not significantly modify these latter indicators. DEN + PB treated rats exhibited prolonged survival and a reduced incidence of tumors compared to those receiving DEN alone. The conclusion drawn is that PB, which typically enhances carcinogenesis when administered subsequent to DEN exposure, diminishes the carcinogen's effect when provided simultaneously. This 'anti-carcinogen' action affects both the initiation and promotion of pre-cancerous lesions.

This research aimed to investigate the effect of phenobarbital (PB), at a sustained dose of 15 mg per rat, on carcinogenesis when concurrently administered with diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 10 mg/kg/day). Wistar rats, weighing 180 g, received treatment with either DEN exclusively or a combination of DEN + PB over periods of 2, 4, and 6 weeks, following our established hepatocarcinogenesis regimen. Following the treatment phase, a statistically significant reduction was observed in both the count and dimensions of induced PAS-positive preneoplastic foci when PB was co-administered with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. The mitotic arrest and the formation of micronuclei, typically observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN-exposed rats, were also significantly curtailed in the DEN + PB treatment group. However, for a treatment duration of only 2 weeks, PB's inclusion did not significantly alter these specific parameters. Animals treated with DEN + PB demonstrated extended survival and a lower tumor incidence in comparison to those receiving DEN alone. It is concluded that PB, which acts as a promoter of carcinogenesis when given after DEN treatment, exerts a suppressive effect on the carcinogen's action when administered simultaneously with DEN. This 'anti-carcinogen' impact influences both the initiation and promotion stages of precancerous lesions.

"Modulatory role of phenobarbital in diethylnitrosamine-induced carcinogenesis through concomitant administration in rats. The current study was designed to clarify the influence of phenobarbital (PB), at an ingested dose of 15 mg per rat, on the carcinogenic process when administered in conjunction with diethylnitrosamine (DEN; 10 mg/kg/day). One hundred eighty-gram Wistar rats were treated either with DEN alone or with DEN plus PB for durations of 2, 4, and 6 weeks, in accordance with our protocol for inducing hepatocarcinogenesis. Upon completion of the treatment, a significant decrease in both the number and size of induced PAS-positive preneoplastic foci was noted when PB was provided simultaneously with DEN for 4 and 6 weeks. Furthermore, the mitotic inhibition and the production of micronuclei, typically observed after partial hepatectomy in DEN-treated rats, were significantly diminished in the DEN + PB treated cohort. In instances where treatment lasted merely 2 weeks, the presence of PB did not significantly affect these aforementioned parameters. Compared to rats treated with DEN alone, DEN + PB treated rats exhibited prolonged survival and a decreased incidence of tumors. The findings indicate that PB, while acting as a carcinogen promoter when administered following DEN exposure, reduces the carcinogenic effect when delivered concurrently. This 'anti-carcinogen' action targets both the initiation and promotion phases of precancerous lesions.

"Germline RB1 Gene Mutations in Patients Presenting with Isolated Unilateral Retinoblastoma. The development of most isolated unilateral retinoblastoma cases is initiated by somatic inactivation of both RB1 gene alleles. However, some affected individuals can transmit a predisposition to retinoblastoma to their offspring. This study aimed to ascertain the frequency and characteristics of germline RB1 gene mutations in patients with isolated unilateral retinoblastoma. DNA from peripheral blood and tumor tissue was analyzed for this purpose. Analysis of tumors from 54 (71%) of 76 informative patients revealed loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic loci. Additionally, constitutional deletions were identified in 3 of 13 uninformative patients. To detect mutations, SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis were performed on 39 randomly selected tumors. Mutations were identified in 21 (91%) of 23 tumors exhibiting LOH. Among 16 tumors without LOH, one mutation was found in 6 (38%), while both mutations were detected in 9 (56%). In total, 45 mutations were identified across tumors from 36 patients. Of these, 39 mutations—comprising 34 small mutations, 2 large structural alterations, and hypermethylation in 3 tumors—were absent in the corresponding peripheral blood DNA. A constitutional mutation was detected in 6 (17%) of the 36 patients, with one of these mutations being associated with reduced expressivity. The presence of a constitutional mutation showed no correlation with an earlier age at treatment. Somatic mosaicism was confirmed in one patient via molecular analysis of peripheral blood DNA and RNA. Furthermore, mosaicism was suggested in two patients lacking detectable peripheral blood mutations, as one displayed multifocal tumors and the other subsequently developed bilateral retinoblastoma.

We conducted DNA analyses on samples from peripheral blood and tumor tissue. Among 76 informative patients, 54 (71%) of their tumors exhibited loss of constitutional heterozygosity (LOH) at intragenic loci. Constitutional deletions were found in 3 of 13 uninformative patients. For 39 randomly chosen tumors, mutation detection was performed using SSCP, hetero-duplex analysis, sequencing, and Southern blot analysis. Twenty-one (91%) of 23 tumors with LOH contained mutations. In tumors without LOH, one mutation was detected in 6 (38%) of 16 cases, and both mutations were identified in 9 (56%). Cumulatively, 45 mutations were discovered in tumors from 36 patients.

No association was observed between the presence of a constitutional mutation and an early age at treatment. Molecular analysis of peripheral blood DNA and RNA confirmed somatic mosaicism in one patient. Additionally, mosaicism was suspected in two patients where no peripheral blood mutation was detected, with one presenting multifocal tumors and the other later developing bilateral retinoblastoma.

While hereditary TP53 mutations are rarely encountered in various human cancers, they are frequently associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Separately, hereditary mutations of TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A, which regulate the cell cycle similarly to TP53, have been noted across several cancer types. We conducted an analysis of a Turkish family diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, investigating the mutation patterns of TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A in peripheral blood, and the loss of heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) of TP53 and P15INK4B/P16INK4A in two tumor specimens. The proband had a seminoma, his daughter a medulloblastoma, and a healthy cousin demonstrated a TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA->ATA; Lys->Ile) in peripheral blood cells. Loss of heterozygosity within the TP53 gene was identified in the tumor tissue derived from the proband's seminoma. Additionally, a P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG->GAG; Ala->Glu) was found in tumor tissues from the proband and his daughter, occurring with the inherited TP53 mutation. This P16INK4A codon 94 mutation constitutes a novel finding specific to Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No other gene alterations were detected among TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, and P16INK4A. The discovery of both the P16INK4A mutation and the hereditary TP53 mutation, irrespective of TP53 gene loss of heterozygosity (seminoma/medulloblastoma), may indicate a shared tumorigenic mechanism. These identified gene alterations in TP53 and P16INK4A could potentially serve as diagnostic tumor markers for this family.",0,0,0,1

"Urinary Bladder Carcinoma Risk in Wegener's Granulomatosis and its Association with Cyclophosphamide Exposure. This study aimed to characterize and evaluate the risk of bladder cancer, and its association with cyclophosphamide therapy, in individuals diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis. A cohort of 1065 Wegener's granulomatosis patients, identified from the population-based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register between 1969 and 1995, was established. Bladder cancer diagnoses within this group were ascertained via linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. A nested matched case-control study was conducted within the cohort to quantify the association between cyclophosphamide exposure and bladder cancer, utilizing odds ratios (ORs) as a measure of relative risk. Furthermore, the cumulative risk of bladder cancer post-Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis and the relative prevalence of pre-existing bladder cancer at the time of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis were assessed within the cohort. The median cumulative cyclophosphamide doses were 113 g for cases (n = 11) and 25 g for controls (n = 25). Bladder cancer risk increased twofold for each 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide dose (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 0.8-4.9). Treatment duration exceeding one year corresponded to an eightfold elevated risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9-69). The absolute bladder cancer risk within the cohort reached 10% at 16 years following a Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis. A history of bladder cancer was observed to be (non-significantly) twice as prevalent as anticipated at the time of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis. These findings indicate a dose-response association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer risk, substantial cumulative risks within the overall cohort, and suggest the potential involvement of risk factors preceding the onset of Wegener's granulomatosis.",0,0,0,1
"The Influence of Cyclophosphamide on Urinary Bladder Cancer Development in Wegener's Granulomatosis Patients. The objective of this research was to investigate and define the risk of bladder cancer, and its connection to cyclophosphamide administration, in patients afflicted with Wegener's granulomatosis. From the national, population-based Swedish Inpatient Register, a cohort comprising 1065 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, diagnosed between 1969 and 1995, was compiled. Subsequently, bladder cancer diagnoses within this cohort were identified by cross-referencing with the Swedish Cancer Register. To evaluate the relationship between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer, a matched case-control study was performed, nested within the cohort, using odds ratios (ORs) as the measure of relative risk. Additionally, the cohort's cumulative risk of bladder cancer after a Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis and the relative prevalence of a prior bladder cancer history at the time of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis were determined. Median cumulative cyclophosphamide doses were 113 g for cases (n = 11) and 25 g for controls (n = 25). The risk of bladder cancer was observed to double with every 10 g increase in cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.9).

This study's objective was to assess the epidemiological profile and characteristics of bladder cancer risk, and its correlation with cyclophosphamide treatment, in individuals diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis. A cohort of 1065 patients diagnosed with Wegener's granulomatosis from 1969-1995 was identified using the population-based, nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register. All instances of bladder cancer within this cohort were identified via linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register. A nested matched case-control investigation was executed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer, expressed as odds ratios (ORs) for relative risk. The cumulative risk of bladder cancer following a Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis, and the relative frequency of a pre-existing bladder cancer history at the point of Wegener's granulomatosis diagnosis, were also calculated within the cohort. Data indicated that the median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide were 113 g for cases (n = 11) and 25 g for controls (n = 25). An elevated risk of bladder cancer was noted, doubling for every 10 g increment of cyclophosphamide (OR = 2.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 4.9). Furthermore, treatment lasting longer than one year was associated with an eightfold increased risk (OR = 7.7, 95% CI 0.9 to 69).

"Detection of BRCA1 Mutations in Primary Breast and Ovarian Carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity data from familial tumors indicate that BRCA1, a gene imparting susceptibility to ovarian and early-onset breast cancer, functions as a tumor suppressor. The BRCA1 region also exhibits allelic loss in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers, suggesting that somatic BRCA1 mutations may occur in these tumors. The BRCA1 coding region was screened for mutations in primary breast and ovarian tumors demonstrating allele loss at the BRCA1 locus. Mutations were identified in 3 of 32 breast and 1 of 12 ovarian carcinomas; all four mutations were germline alterations and presented in early-onset cancers. These results suggest that mutation of BRCA1 may not be critical in the development of the majority of breast and ovarian cancers that arise in the absence of a mutant germline allele.",0,0,0,1
"Prevalence and Nature of BRCA1 Alterations in Primary Breast and Ovarian Carcinomas. Data from familial tumor loss of heterozygosity imply that BRCA1, a gene conferring susceptibility to early-onset breast and ovarian cancer, encodes a tumor suppressor.

"Essential Role of the Tumor Suppressor Gene Brca1 in Murine Embryonic Cell Proliferation. Human BRCA1 gene mutations are linked to an elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Our findings indicate that heterozygous Brca1 (+/-) mice appear normal, are fertile, and do not develop tumors by 11 months of age. Conversely, homozygous Brca1 (5-6) mutant mice exhibit embryonic lethality, perishing before day 7.5 of gestation. These mutant embryos display stunted development and a complete absence of mesoderm. While the extraembryonic region is anomalous, lethality cannot be salvaged by aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos. In vivo, mutant embryos do not show heightened apoptosis but demonstrate diminished cell proliferation, correlating with reduced levels of cyclin E and mdm-2, a known regulator of p53 activity. Furthermore, the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is markedly elevated in these mutant embryos. Supporting these in vivo observations, in vitro studies reveal severely impaired growth of mutant blastocysts.

"Brca1, a Tumor Suppressor Gene, is Indispensable for Embryonic Cell Proliferation in Mice. A predisposition to breast and ovarian cancers in humans is associated with mutations in the BRCA1 gene. We report that Brca1 +/- mice are normal, fertile, and free of tumors at 11 months of age. However, homozygous Brca1 (5-6) mutant mice experience lethality before day 7.5 of embryogenesis. Mutant embryos are characterized by poor development and a lack of mesoderm formation. The extraembryonic region is abnormal; notably, this lethality is not rescued by aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos. In vivo analysis shows that mutant embryos do not have increased apoptosis but do exhibit reduced cellular proliferation. This reduction is accompanied by decreased expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, which regulates p53 activity. A dramatic increase in the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is also observed in mutant embryos. These in vivo findings are corroborated by in vitro evidence of severely impaired mutant blastocyst growth. Therefore, the premature death of Brca1 (5-6) mutant embryos before gastrulation may result from an inability to achieve the necessary proliferative burst for germ layer development.",0,0,0,1
"Requirement of the Tumor Suppressor Brca1 for Murine Embryonic Cell Division. Mutations within the human BRCA1 gene confer a susceptibility to breast and ovarian malignancies.

In contrast, homozygous Brca1 (5-6) mutant mice fail to survive beyond embryonic day 7.5. These mutant embryos present with underdeveloped structures and a total absence of mesoderm. The extraembryonic tissues are anomalous, yet their demise is not ameliorated by aggregation with wild-type tetraploid embryos. In vivo observations indicate no elevated apoptosis in mutant embryos; instead, they display diminished cell proliferation alongside reduced expression of cyclin E and mdm-2, a crucial regulator of p53. Concurrently, the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is substantially elevated within these mutant embryos. Further supporting these in vivo findings, mutant blastocyst expansion is profoundly hampered in vitro.

"Detection of low beta hexosaminidase A levels in healthy individuals with apparent enzyme deficiency. Measurable beta hexosaminidase A (Hex A) activity was observed in cultured skin fibroblasts and melanoma tissue obtained from healthy subjects previously identified as having a Hex A deficiency similar to that seen in Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) patients. Quantification and identification of Hex A, representing 3.5% to 6.9% of total beta hexosaminidase activity, were achieved through cellulose acetate gel electrophoresis, DEAE-cellulose ion-exchange chromatography, radial immunodiffusion, and radioimmunoassay.

"No Significant Contribution of Common BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutations to Early Prostate Cancer in Jewish Men. Families with a high prevalence of hereditary breast cancer, confirmed to possess truncating mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, exhibit an elevated incidence of prostate cancer in male kin. Our objective was to assess if prevalent germline mutations of BRCA1 or BRCA2 in Ashkenazi Jewish males conferred a predisposition to prostate cancer. We analyzed genomic DNA from 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) or 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, predominantly diagnosed at a younger age, for the most frequent germline mutations within each gene observed in the Ashkenazi population. This investigation possessed the power to identify a 4-5-fold increase in prostate cancer risk attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. However, only one patient (1.15%; 95% CI, 0-3.6%) carried the heterozygous BRCA1 mutant allele, and only two patients (2.4%; 95% CI, 0-6.2%) were heterozygous for the BRCA2 mutation.

"A genetic linkage map construction using six polymorphic DNA markers flanking the familial adenomatous polyposis gene on chromosome 5. This report details a genetic linkage map incorporating six polymorphic DNA markers situated proximally to the familial adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene on chromosome 5q. The analysis involved 155 genotyped individuals from nine FAP families, contributing over 90 meioses to the linkage study. Critical recombination events, informative across three or more loci, were identified, enabling robust ordering of specific map segments. No evidence of genetic heterogeneity was observed, as all families demonstrated linkage between the gene and at least one chromosome 5 marker. Recombination analysis and two-point linkage data substantiate the locus order as centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5.62-APC-EF5.44-YN5.48-telomere, although the precise placement of EF5.44 could be within the L5.62-APC or ECB27-L5.62 intervals. No recombinants were detected between APC and either EF5.44 or YN5.48; however, prior deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage studies in FAP indicate that YN5.48 is located 1-3 cM from APC. The current investigation suggests that YN5.48 and L5.62 define a compact chromosomal region on chromosome 5 where the EF5.44 locus resides in very close proximity to the APC gene. These findings are valuable for utilizing flanking markers in the presymptomatic diagnosis of FAP and for providing a high-resolution map of the region to facilitate isolation of the APC gene itself, as well as for further investigating the role of chromosome 5 deletions in the pathogenesis of sporadic colorectal cancer.",0,0,0,1
"High-resolution genetic mapping of the familial adenomatous polyposis locus on chromosome 5 using polymorphic DNA markers. A high-resolution genetic linkage map, comprising six polymorphic DNA markers in the vicinity of the familial adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene on chromosome 5q, is presented. Linkage analysis was conducted using over 90 meioses obtained from 155 genotyped members across nine FAP kindreds. The identification of critical recombination events, informative across multiple loci, enabled a confident establishment of partial map order. Genetic heterogeneity was not evident, as all examined families showed linkage between the FAP gene and at least one marker on chromosome 5. Data from recombination analysis and two-point linkage studies support the following marker order: centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5.62-APC-EF5.44-YN5.48-telomere, with a noted ambiguity for EF5.44 potentially lying within the L5.62-APC or ECB27-L5.62 intervals. Despite the absence of observed recombinants between APC and EF5.44 or YN5.48 in this study, previous research involving deletion mapping in colorectal carcinomas and linkage analysis in FAP patients suggests a distance of 1-3 cM between YN5.48 and APC. This study indicates that the loci YN5.48 and L5.62 delimit a restricted segment of chromosome 5, within which EF5.44 is positioned very close to the APC gene.

A genetic linkage map, incorporating six polymorphic DNA markers proximal to the familial adenomatous polyposis (APC) gene on chromosome 5q, is described. The study population comprised 155 genotyped individuals from nine FAP families, providing in excess of 90 meioses for detailed linkage analysis. Crucial recombination events, informative for three or more loci, were identified, enabling a precise ordering of specific segments within the map. No evidence for genetic heterogeneity was found, as all participating families demonstrated linkage between at least one chromosome 5 marker and the FAP gene. Both recombination data and two-point linkage analysis consistently supported the locus order: centromere-pi 227-C11P11-ECB27-L5.62-APC-EF5.44-YN5.48-telomere, although the specific placement of EF5.44 remains uncertain, potentially residing within the L5.62-APC or ECB27-L5.62 intervals.

"Regulation of axonal chemoattractant activity by metalloprotease action. Netrin-1, an axonal chemoattractant, directs spinal commissural axons through the activation of its receptor, DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer).

"Erythropoietin's Reversal of Anemia-Mediated Diminishment of Cyclophosphamide Efficacy in Rat Tumors. This investigation aimed to determine how preventing anemia through recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) treatment influences cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in solid experimental tumors. Anemia was induced by a single intravenous carboplatin dose (50 mg/kg), causing a sustained 30% decrease in hemoglobin concentration. In a separate group, anemia development was averted with rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) administered subcutaneously thrice weekly, commencing 7 days prior to carboplatin. DS-sarcoma rat tumors were implanted subcutaneously on the hind foot dorsum four days post-carboplatin administration. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO monotherapy affected tumor growth rate. A single intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) administered five days after implantation resulted in tumor growth delay followed by subsequent regrowth. In the anemic cohort, the growth delay was markedly shorter (8.6 days) compared to nonanemic controls (13.3 days). Conversely, in the group where anemia was prevented by rHuEPO, the growth delay matched that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These findings indicate that chemotherapy-induced anemia diminishes cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in tumors, while anemia correction using rHuEPO (epoetin alpha) enhances sensitivity, likely due to improved oxygen delivery to the tumor tissue.",0,0,0,1
"Recombinant Erythropoietin Counteracts Anemia-Induced Attenuation of Cyclophosphamide Cytotoxicity in Rat Tumors. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of preventing anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on the cytotoxic activity of cyclophosphamide against solid experimental tumors. Anemia was established via a single intravenous carboplatin injection (50 mg/kg), which led to a persistent 30% reduction in hemoglobin levels. A second group received rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) subcutaneously three times per week, beginning seven days before carboplatin application, to prevent anemia. Four days after carboplatin treatment, DS-sarcoma of the rat tumors were implanted subcutaneously onto the hind foot dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatments independently affected the tumor growth rate. When tumors were treated with a single intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) five days post-implantation, a period of growth delay followed by tumor regrowth was observed. The anemic group exhibited a significantly shorter growth delay (8.6 days) compared to the nonanemic control group (13.3 days). In the group where rHuEPO prevented anemia, the growth delay was comparable to that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These results suggest that cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in tumors is reduced by chemotherapy-induced anemia, and that correcting anemia with rHuEPO (epoetin alpha) increases tumor sensitivity, possibly by enhancing oxygen supply to the tumor tissue.",0,0,0,1
"Amelioration of Anemia-Dependent Cyclophosphamide Cytotoxicity Impairment in Rat Tumors by Erythropoietin. This study sought to investigate the influence of anemia prevention, achieved through recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) administration, on the cytotoxic effectiveness of cyclophosphamide in experimental solid tumors. Anemia was instigated by a single intravenous dose of carboplatin (50 mg/kg), resulting in a prolonged 30% decrease in hemoglobin concentration. For a second experimental group, rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) was subcutaneously administered three times weekly, starting one week prior to carboplatin, to preclude anemia. Four days following carboplatin treatment, DS-sarcoma of the rat tumors were surgically implanted subcutaneously onto the hind foot dorsum. It was observed that neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment, when administered alone, impacted the tumor growth rate. Five days after implantation, tumors received a single intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg), leading to an initial growth delay followed by tumor resurgence. The anemic group demonstrated a statistically shorter growth delay (8.6 days) relative to the nonanemic control group (13.3 days). Crucially, the group in which rHuEPO prevented anemia exhibited a growth delay equivalent to that of nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These findings propose that chemotherapy-induced anemia diminishes the cytotoxic action of cyclophosphamide in tumors, whereas rectifying anemia with rHuEPO (epoetin alpha) heightens tumor sensitivity, likely attributable to an improved oxygen supply to the tumor microenvironment.",0,0,0,1
"Erythropoietin Restitution of Cyclophosphamide Efficacy Against Anemia-Compromised Rat Tumors. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of preventing anemia, via recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy, on cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity within solid experimental tumors. Anemia was induced using a single intravenous carboplatin dose (50 mg/kg), which resulted in a persistent 30% reduction of hemoglobin levels. In a parallel group, rHuEPO (1000 IU/kg) was administered subcutaneously three times per week, commencing seven days before carboplatin application, to prevent anemia development. Four days after carboplatin treatment, DS-sarcoma rat tumors were implanted subcutaneously on the hind foot dorsum. Neither carboplatin nor rHuEPO treatment, in isolation, affected the tumor growth kinetics. Upon treating tumors with a single intraperitoneal dose of cyclophosphamide (60 mg/kg) five days post-implantation, a period of arrested growth followed by tumor progression was noted. The anemic group displayed a significantly reduced growth delay (8.6 days) compared to nonanemic controls (13.3 days). Conversely, the group where anemia was mitigated by rHuEPO treatment showed a growth delay duration comparable to nonanemic controls (13.3 days). These data suggest that chemotherapy-associated anemia compromises cyclophosphamide's cytotoxic potential in tumors, while rHuEPO (epoetin alpha) correction of anemia enhances tumor responsiveness, ostensibly due to an augmented oxygen supply to neoplastic tissue.",0,0,0,1
"The Efficacy and Safety of Paclitaxel, Cisplatin, and Gemcitabine Combination Chemotherapy in Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma Management. BACKGROUND: Advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy combinations, which improve quality of life and survival. The emergence of novel active agents presents an opportunity for developing more effective therapeutic strategies for this disease. METHODS: This study aimed to assess the feasibility, response rates, and toxicity profile of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine regimen in metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2 were administered paclitaxel (135 mg/m² intravenously over 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m² intravenously over 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m² intravenously over 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, every 4 weeks. While consolidation radiotherapy was planned for responders and 24 patients received pre-planned second-line chemotherapy post-progression, the reported response and toxicity rates pertain exclusively to the initial chemotherapy. RESULTS: All patients underwent toxicity assessment, and 34 were evaluable for response. An objective response was noted in 73.5% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), including 4 complete responses (11.7%). According to intention-to-treat analysis, the overall response rate was 71.4% (95% CI, 53.7-85.4%). Across 154 treatment courses, the median dose intensity for paclitaxel was 131 mg/m² (97.3%), for cisplatin 117 mg/m² (97.3%), and for gemcitabine 1378 mg/m² (86.2%). WHO Grade 3-4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 39.9% and 11.4% of patients, respectively. One treatment-related fatality was recorded. Nonhematologic toxicities were generally mild. After a median follow-up period of 22 months, the median progression-free survival was 7 months, and the median overall survival time was 16 months. CONCLUSIONS: The combined regimen of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine demonstrates good tolerability and substantial activity in metastatic NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Improved quality of life and survival for advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) patients are associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens. The introduction of new active agents holds potential for developing more effective treatments for this malignancy. METHODS: This study's primary objective was to determine the safety, response, and tolerability of a triple-drug combination—paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine—for metastatic NSCLC. Thirty-five chemotherapy-naive patients, all with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, received paclitaxel (135 mg/m² IV over 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m² IV over 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m² IV over 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, administered every four weeks. While responding individuals were slated for consolidation radiotherapy and 24 patients received subsequent second-line chemotherapy following disease progression, the reported response and toxicity rates specifically pertain to the administered chemotherapy regimen. RESULTS: Toxicity was assessed in all patients; response was assessable in 34. An objective response was achieved in 73.5% of patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), with 4 complete responses (11.7%) among them. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed an overall response rate of 71.4% (95% CI, 53.7-85.4%).

The availability of new active therapeutic agents suggests the potential for developing even more efficacious regimens for this condition. METHODS: This investigation aimed to determine the feasibility, response rate, and adverse effects of a paclitaxel, cisplatin, and gemcitabine combination for treating metastatic NSCLC. A cohort of 35 consecutive chemotherapy-naive patients with Stage IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ranging from 0 to 2 received paclitaxel (135 mg/m² IV for 3 hours) on Day 1, cisplatin (120 mg/m² IV for 6 hours) on Day 1, and gemcitabine (800 mg/m² IV for 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 8, administered every 4 weeks. Although consolidation radiotherapy was planned for those who responded, and 24 patients subsequently received second-line chemotherapy after disease progression, the reported response and toxicity data strictly pertain to the initial chemotherapy protocol. RESULTS: All patients were assessed for toxicity; 34 were eligible for response evaluation. An objective response was documented in 73.5% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.6-87.1%), which included 4 complete responses (11.7%).

"Genomic Rearrangements of the APC Tumor Suppressor Gene Identified in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome, is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene. While most known APC mutations involve single-nucleotide changes or small indels that truncate the protein, intragenic APC rearrangements have been poorly characterized, and their frequency in FAP patients remains unknown. In a screen of 49 prospective FAP families, we uncovered 26 distinct germline APC mutations across 30 families. Notably, four of these mutations were genomic rearrangements, originating from Alu element-mediated homologous and nonhomologous recombinations. Two of these four rearrangements exhibited complexity, involving both nucleotide deletion and insertion. Specifically, one rearrangement led to the deletion of exons 11 and 12, while two others caused either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement significantly altered the sequence within intron 14; although not affecting APC coding sequence at the genomic DNA level, it induced inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially detected through cDNA analysis, a method essential as traditional exon-by-exon mutation screening would not have identified them. The discovery of a splicing-affecting rearrangement without coding exon alteration further highlights the critical role of cDNA in mutation analysis. The presence of four genomic rearrangements among 30 identified mutations indicates that these alterations represent a common type of germline APC mutation.",0,0,0,1
"Novel Genomic Rearrangements of the APC Tumor Suppressor Gene in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Germline mutations within the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene are responsible for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary form of colorectal cancer. While most reported APC mutations consist of single-nucleotide alterations, minor insertions, or small deletions that lead to truncated protein products, well-characterized intragenic rearrangements of APC have been scarce, and their prevalence among FAP patients remains unclear. Our investigation of 49 potential FAP families led to the detection of 26 distinct germline APC mutations across 30 families. Among these, four mutations were identified as genomic rearrangements, arising from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these four rearrangements presented as complex events, encompassing both nucleotide deletions and insertions. Specifically, one rearrangement entailed the deletion of exons 11 and 12, and two others caused either a complete or partial deletion of exon 14. The fourth rearrangement significantly altered the intronic sequence within intron 14; despite not affecting any APC coding sequence at the genomic DNA level, it provoked aberrant splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements were initially discerned through cDNA analysis and would have been missed by mutation detection methods relying on individual exon screening. The observation of a rearrangement impacting splicing without altering coding exons further underscores the significance of employing cDNA for comprehensive mutation analysis.

"Frequency and Characterization of APC Tumor Suppressor Gene Genomic Rearrangements in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colorectal cancer predisposition syndrome, stems from germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene. While the majority of characterized APC mutations are single-nucleotide changes or small insertions/deletions that result in protein truncation, intragenic genomic rearrangements of APC have not been thoroughly described, and their prevalence in FAP patients remains undefined. In a cohort of 49 candidate FAP families, we identified 26 distinct germline APC mutations across 30 families. Notably, four of these mutations constituted genomic rearrangements, mediated by Alu elements through homologous and nonhomologous recombination events. Two of these four rearrangements were intricate, involving both deletion and insertion of nucleotides. Specifically, one rearrangement caused the deletion of exons 11 and 12, while two others led to either complete or partial deletion of exon 14. A fourth rearrangement profoundly modified the sequence within intron 14; although it did not alter any coding sequence of APC at the genomic DNA level, it did induce inappropriate splicing of exon 14. These rearrangements, which were initially discerned through cDNA analysis, would have eluded detection by mutation screening methods examining each exon individually. The finding of a rearrangement that did not affect coding exons but nevertheless impacted splicing further underscores the value of cDNA for comprehensive mutation analysis.

"Genomic Rearrangements of the APC Tumor Suppressor Gene: A Significant Etiology in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. The hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is precipitated by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene. Although nearly all APC mutations previously identified are single-nucleotide alterations, minor insertions, or small deletions leading to protein truncation, well-characterized intragenic APC rearrangements have not been extensively documented, and their prevalence among FAP patients is ambiguous. Our investigation involved screening 49 potential FAP families, ultimately identifying 26 distinct germline APC mutations in 30 families. Notably, four of these mutations were classified as genomic rearrangements, resulting from homologous and nonhomologous recombinations mediated by Alu elements. Two of these four rearrangements were complex in nature, encompassing both nucleotide deletion and insertion events.

"Retinyl Acetate's Co-Carcinogenic Role in Butylated Hydroxyanisole-Induced Forestomach Carcinogenesis in Male F344 Rats. This study investigated the potential modulating effect of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced tumorigenesis in the rat forestomach. Male F344 rats, aged 5 weeks, were fed diets containing either 1% or 2% BHA by weight, concurrently receiving RA-supplemented drinking water at varying concentrations (w/v) over a 52-week period. Among groups administered 2% BHA, while all animals displayed pronounced hyperplastic alterations of the forestomach epithelium, the concurrent administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P < 0.05) elevated the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, including 2 rats with carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, including one rat with carcinoma) observed in the group without RA. In rats receiving 1% BHA, RA co-administration at doses of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.25% demonstrated a dose-dependent augmentative influence on the progression of BHA-induced epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, exclusively papillomas, developed in 3 rats (17%) with 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration. RA administered alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the forestomach. These findings suggest that RA functions as a co-carcinogen in BHA-mediated forestomach carcinogenesis in the rat.",0,0,0,1
"The Joint Carcinogenic Effect of Retinyl Acetate on Butylated Hydroxyanisole-Stimulated Forestomach Cancer Development in Male F344 Rats. The influence of retinyl acetate (RA) as a potential modifier on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced tumorigenesis in the forestomach of rats was assessed. Male F344 rats, 5 weeks old, were maintained on diets containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight, alongside drinking water fortified with various concentrations (w/v) of RA for 52 weeks. In the cohorts receiving 2% BHA, although substantial hyperplastic changes were evident in the forestomach epithelium of all subjects, the concomitant provision of 0.25% RA markedly (P < 0.05) increased the occurrence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, with 2 rats exhibiting carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, with one rat exhibiting carcinoma) in the group not receiving RA. For rats given 1% BHA, RA supplied at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.25% displayed a dose-responsive enhancing effect on the emergence of BHA-provoked epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all identified as papillomas, arose in 3 rats (17%) when 0.25% RA was co-administered and in one rat (10%) with 0.05% RA co-administration.

The possible modifying influence of retinyl acetate (RA) on butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced tumor formation in the forestomach of rats was investigated. Five-week-old male F344 rats were fed diets containing 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously received drinking water supplemented with RA at different concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In the groups administered 2% BHA, while all animals exhibited pronounced hyperplastic alterations in the forestomach epithelium, the co-administration of 0.25% RA led to a significant (P < 0.05) rise in the frequency of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, with 2 rats showing carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, with one rat showing carcinoma) in the RA-free water group. Among rats given 1% BHA, RA co-administered at doses of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.25% demonstrated a dose-dependent exacerbating effect on the occurrence of BHA-prompted epithelial hyperplasia. Tumors, all categorized as papillomas, developed in 3 rats (17%) receiving 0.25% RA and in one rat (10%) receiving 0.05% RA alongside BHA.

The role of retinyl acetate (RA) as a potential modulator of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA)-induced tumorigenesis in the rat forestomach was evaluated. Male F344 rats, aged 5 weeks, were provided diets containing either 1% or 2% BHA by weight and simultaneously given drinking water supplemented with RA at diverse concentrations (w/v) for 52 weeks. In the groups supplied with 2% BHA, despite all animals displaying pronounced hyperplastic changes in the forestomach epithelium, the concurrent administration of 0.25% RA significantly (P < 0.05) boosted the incidence of forestomach tumors (squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma) to 60% (9/15, with 2 rats having carcinoma) from 15% (3/20, with one rat having carcinoma) in the group that received RA-free water. For rats consuming 1% BHA, RA co-administered at doses of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, or 0.25% exhibited a dose-dependent potentiating effect on the development of the BHA-triggered epithelial hyperplasia.

"An In Vivo/In Vitro Cytogenetic Assessment of Ifosfamide, Mesna, and Their Combined Effects on Rabbit Peripheral Lymphocytes. Ifosfamide (IFO), an alkylating nitrogen mustard, functions as an antineoplastic agent but is known for its severe urotoxic effects, including hemorrhagic cystitis. To mitigate this adverse effect, IFO is often co-administered with sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna). This study investigated the cytogenetic impacts of IFO and Mesna, administered individually to rabbit lymphocytes in vivo and subsequently analyzed in vitro. Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI), and Mitotic Index served as cytogenetic markers. Results showed that Mesna co-administration with IFO lowered SCE frequencies compared to IFO administration alone. Furthermore, high concentrations of Mesna administered independently resulted in notable reductions in PRI when contrasted with IFO at an equivalent concentration in lymphocytes. In conclusion, Mesna significantly attenuates IFO's genotoxicity, yet at elevated concentrations, it exhibits an inhibitory effect on the drug's cytostatic activity.",0,0,0,1
"Cytogenetic Effects of Ifosfamide, Mesna, and Co-administration on Peripheral Rabbit Lymphocytes: An In Vivo/In Vitro Study. Ifosfamide (IFO), an antineoplastic alkylating nitrogen mustard, is associated with substantial urotoxicity, manifesting as hemorrhagic cystitis. Consequently, its administration often involves the concurrent use of sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) to prevent or reduce this toxicity. In this in vivo/in vitro cytogenetic investigation, IFO and Mesna were individually applied to rabbit lymphocytes, which were subsequently cultured. Cytogenetic endpoints, including sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI), and Mitotic Index, were evaluated. The combined administration of Mesna with IFO led to a reduction in SCE frequency when compared to IFO given alone. Additionally, high concentrations of Mesna, when administered independently, demonstrated significant decreases in PRI in contrast to IFO applied at the same concentration to lymphocytes. This indicates that Mesna substantially diminishes IFO's genotoxic potential, although high concentrations of Mesna can concurrently inhibit the drug's cytostatic action.",0,0,0,1
"In Vivo/In Vitro Cytogenetic Analysis of Ifosfamide, Mesna, and Their Combination on Rabbit Peripheral Lymphocytes. Ifosfamide (IFO), an alkylating nitrogen mustard utilized as an antineoplastic agent, is recognized for its severe urotoxic effects, primarily hemorrhagic cystitis. To counteract this adverse reaction, IFO is typically co-administered with Mesna (sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate). This study assessed the cytogenetic responses of rabbit lymphocytes following in vivo administration of IFO and Mesna, both individually, with subsequent in vitro development. Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI), and Mitotic Index were the cytogenetic parameters measured. The results indicate that Mesna, when combined with IFO, significantly lowers the frequency of SCEs compared to IFO given without Mesna. Furthermore, high concentrations of Mesna administered alone elicited a significant reduction in the PRI relative to IFO at an equivalent concentration in lymphocytes. Therefore, Mesna effectively mitigates IFO's genotoxicity, but when used in high concentrations, it also exerts an inhibitory effect on the drug's cytostatic activity.",0,0,0,1
"Investigating the Cytogenetic Impact of Ifosfamide and Mesna, Individually and Combined, on Peripheral Rabbit Lymphocytes In Vivo/In Vitro. Ifosfamide (IFO), an alkylating nitrogen mustard, serves as an antineoplastic agent but is notoriously associated with severe urotoxicity, manifesting as hemorrhagic cystitis. To counteract this, sodium 2-sulfanylethanesulfonate (Mesna) is routinely co-administered. This investigation explored the cytogenetic effects by administering IFO and Mesna separately to rabbit lymphocytes in vivo, followed by their in vitro development. Cytogenetic markers assessed included sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs), proliferation rate index (PRI), and Mitotic Index. Data revealed that Mesna, in conjunction with IFO, decreased SCE frequencies relative to IFO administration alone. Additionally, high concentrations of Mesna, when given in isolation, led to significant decreases in the PRI compared to IFO's effect at the same concentration on lymphocytes. Consequently, Mesna markedly reduces the genotoxic effects of IFO, although at elevated concentrations, it simultaneously exerts an inhibitory influence on the drug's cytostatic action.",0,0,0,1

"Hormonal Influences on Breast Cancer Risk. A study was conducted on 50 menopausal women undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Twenty-nine of these participants had experienced surgical menopause, with a mean age of 45.7 years. The hypothesis posited that progestins could counteract estrogenic stimulation's impact on mammary and endometrial target tissues in women receiving HRT. The therapy regime involved 1.25 mg/day of conjugated estrogens (Premarin) for 21 days monthly, alongside 10 mg/day of Medroxyprogesterone acetate for 10 days each month. The average treatment duration spanned 18 months. Breast changes were monitored during follow-up through symptom assessment, physical examination, and plate thermography. Twenty-one patients reported mastodynia. Physical examination identified a slight increase in breast firmness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nodularity in 2 women. Thermography validated excessive breast stimulation in one woman experiencing moderate mastodynia and in five out of seven women with severe mastodynia. Reducing the estrogen dosage by half successfully normalized these conditions. The findings indicate that HRT can be administered safely, provided certain criteria are met: 1) a comprehensive preliminary patient assessment covering clinical, metabolic, cytologic, and mammographic aspects; 2) a cyclic treatment regimen incorporating a 10-day progestative phase; and 3) regular, thorough follow-up, including precise thermographic assessment of breast target tissues.",0,0,0,1

"Validation of BRCA1 through Germline Mutation Analysis in Ten Families Affected by Breast and Ovarian Cancer. This study presents genetic evidence supporting the identification of the candidate BRCA1 gene by characterizing germline mutations in a cohort of 63 breast cancer patients and 10 ovarian cancer patients across ten families where cancer was linked to chromosome 17q21. Nine distinct mutations were identified following the screening of BRCA1 DNA and RNA using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing. Seven of these mutations resulted in protein truncations at various locations within the gene. A single missense mutation, independently observed in two families, caused the loss of a cysteine in the zinc binding domain. Furthermore, an intronic single basepair substitution was found to abolish an acceptor site and activate a cryptic splice site, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and subsequent chain termination. Notably, the four families exhibiting both breast and ovarian cancer harbored chain termination mutations situated in the N-terminal region of the protein.",0,0,0,1

One missense mutation, independently observed in two family lineages, caused the absence of a cysteine residue within the zinc binding domain. Furthermore, an intronic single basepair substitution was found to obliterate an acceptor site and induce a cryptic splice site activation, leading to a 59 basepair insertion and subsequent chain termination. The four families presenting with both breast and ovarian cancer possessed chain termination mutations situated within the N-terminal portion of the protein.",0,0,0,1
"Characterization of BRCA1 Germline Mutations Confirming Gene Identity in Ten Breast and Ovarian Cancer Kindreds. We present compelling genetic evidence affirming the identity of BRCA1 as a candidate gene, established through the characterization of germline mutations in 63 individuals diagnosed with breast cancer and 10 with ovarian cancer, drawn from ten kindreds demonstrating cancer linkage to chromosome 17q21. Nine disparate mutations were identified following the examination of BRCA1 DNA and RNA utilizing single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and direct sequencing techniques. Seven of these mutations induced protein truncations at multiple sites across the gene. A unique missense mutation, independently identified in two separate kindreds, resulted in the deletion of a cysteine within the zinc binding domain. Moreover, an intronic single basepair alteration was observed to eliminate an acceptor site and concurrently trigger a cryptic splice site, culminating in a 59 basepair insertion and protein chain termination. Specifically, the four kindreds presenting with both breast and ovarian malignancies exhibited chain termination mutations located in the N-terminal half of the protein.",0,0,0,1
"A Comprehensive Analysis of RB1 Germline Mutation Types in Hereditary Retinoblastoma. Investigations were conducted to identify germline RB1 mutations in 119 individuals diagnosed with hereditary retinoblastoma. Following initial detection of mutations in 48 patients through Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis, the remaining 71 patients underwent further investigation. Utilizing heteroduplex analysis, nonisotopic SSCP, and direct sequencing, germline mutations leading to premature termination codons or disrupted splice signals were discovered in 51 (72%) of these 71 patients. Additionally, four patients exhibited rare sequence variants. No specific region of the RB1 gene demonstrated a preference for single base substitutions, though recurrent transitions were noted at most of the 14 codons within RB1. Intriguingly, no mutations were found in exons 25-27, despite the presence of two CGA codons, suggesting that mutations in the 3-terminal region of RB1 might not be oncogenic. Combining these findings with previous data, mutations were ultimately identified in 99 (83%) of the 119 patients. The mutational landscape comprised 15% large deletions, 26% small length alterations, and 42% base substitutions. Importantly, no correlation was established between the position of frameshift or nonsense mutations and clinical characteristics such as age at diagnosis, tumor foci count, or the presence of nonocular tumors.",0,0,0,1
"Characterization of RB1 Germline Mutations in Hereditary Retinoblastoma Patients. The germline RB1 mutation status was investigated in a cohort of 119 patients afflicted with hereditary retinoblastoma. While mutations in 48 patients had been previously identified via Southern blot hybridization and PCR fragment-length analysis, this study focused on the comprehensive analysis of the remaining 71 individuals. Through the application of heteroduplex analysis, nonisotopic SSCP, and direct sequencing, germline mutations responsible for premature termination codons or compromised splice signals were detected in 51 (72%) of these 71 patients. Furthermore, four patients displayed uncommon sequence variants. No particular region of the RB1 gene showed a predisposition to single base substitutions; however, recurrent transitions were observed across most of the 14 codons within RB1. Notably, exons 25-27, which contain two CGA codons, were devoid of mutations, leading to the hypothesis that mutations within the 3-terminal region of the RB1 gene may lack oncogenic potential. When these new findings were integrated with prior research, a total of 99 (83%) of the 119 patients were found to harbor mutations. The identified mutation types included 15% large deletions, 26% small length alterations, and 42% base substitutions.

"The Essential Role of BRCA1 in Transcription-Coupled Repair of Oxidative DNA Damage. BRCA1, a gene linked to breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, codes for a zinc finger protein whose precise function remains to be elucidated. Its interaction with the DNA repair protein Rad51, alongside alterations in its phosphorylation state and cellular distribution following exposure to DNA-damaging agents, strongly implies a function for BRCA1 in DNA repair processes. This study demonstrates that mouse embryonic stem cells lacking BRCA1 exhibit impairments in performing transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. Furthermore, these cells display heightened sensitivity to both ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. These findings collectively propose that BRCA1 is involved, either directly or indirectly, in the transcription-coupled repair pathway for oxidative DNA damage.",0,0,0,1
"BRCA1's Requirement for the Transcription-Coupled Repair of Oxidative DNA Damage. The BRCA1 gene, associated with susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers, produces a zinc finger protein whose function is not yet fully understood. Observations such as the binding of BRCA1 protein with the DNA repair protein Rad51, and changes in its phosphorylation and cellular location after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, are consistent with a role in DNA repair for BRCA1. Here, we present evidence that mouse embryonic stem cells that lack BRCA1 are unable to effectively perform transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. Additionally, these cells show increased susceptibility to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. These results indicate that BRCA1 contributes, either directly or indirectly, to the transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage.",0,0,0,1

This research establishes that mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in BRCA1 exhibit a compromised capacity for transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, these cells demonstrate elevated sensitivity to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide. Consequently, these findings propose that BRCA1 participates in the transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage, whether through direct or indirect mechanisms.",0,0,0,1

"Concurrent Kaposi Sarcoma and T-cell Lymphoma in a Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Patient. A 24-year-old male, diagnosed with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) characterized by eczema, recurrent mild infections, and thrombocytopenia, presented with a mediastinal mass, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and pronounced thrombocytopenia. Immune function assessments, including immunoglobulin concentrations and T-cell populations, were within normal limits. Furthermore, his T lymphocytes exhibited normal proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and the combination of neuraminidase/galactose oxidase. However, their proliferative capacity in response to anti-CD43 antibody and periodate was reduced, which aligns with the clinical diagnosis of WAS. An initial biopsy of an inguinal lymph node unexpectedly identified Kaposi sarcoma. Subsequent to a splenectomy performed to elevate the platelet count, a biopsy of the mediastinal mass revealed T-cell large cell lymphoma. Investigations of the biopsied tissue for Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus were negative, as were blood studies, including polymerase chain reaction, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This case represents the initial documented instance of Kaposi sarcoma emerging in an individual with a congenital immunodeficiency syndrome. While Kaposi sarcoma typically arises in contexts of severe immunosuppression, such as post-allograft transplantation or HIV infection, we hypothesize that the patient's prolonged survival despite mild immunosuppression was the primary determinant in the development of Kaposi sarcoma.",0,0,0,1

"Paternal Allele Germline Mutation Preference in Retinoblastoma. In 70% of retinoblastoma tumors, malignant proliferation initiates with loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 13q14, where the wild-type retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is lost, leaving a pre-existing mutated RB1 allele. The initial mutational event—whether a deletion, duplication, or point mutation (details forthcoming)—occurs either in the germline (characteristic of all bilateral patients) or within a somatic retinal cell (typical for most unilateral patients). A majority of bilateral retinoblastoma cases lack a family history, implying novel germline mutations arising in the gametes or early embryo. We investigated the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumors from eight distinct non-familial cases using RB1-linked genetic markers. Our findings revealed that six tumors retained the paternal allele, while three retained the maternal allele. Specifically, among the three unilateral tumors, only one exhibited retention of the paternal RB1 allele. Consequently, no evidence supports the preferential retention of the paternal RB1 allele in retinoblastoma, unlike observations in osteosarcoma. In contrast, tumors from four out of five bilateral patients did retain the paternal RB1 allele. This suggests that novel germline RB1 mutations might occur more frequently during spermatogenesis compared to oogenesis, or that early embryonic imprinting influences chromosomal vulnerability to mutation.",0,0,0,1
"Paternal Allele Predominance in Retinoblastoma Germline Mutations. The onset of malignant proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumors is triggered by a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 13q14, a process where the normal retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is eliminated, and an already mutated RB1 allele persists within the tumor. The primary allele-specific mutational event—encompassing deletion, duplication, or a point mutation (manuscript in preparation)—originates either in the germline, as seen in all bilateral patients, or in a somatic retinal cell, which is common in most unilateral patients. Most bilateral patients present without a family history of retinoblastoma, leading to the assumption that these are new germline mutations originating in the egg, sperm, or during early embryonic development. Utilizing RB1-linked genetic markers, we determined the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumors sourced from eight unrelated, non-familial cases. Results indicated that six tumors preserved the paternal allele, while three preserved the maternal allele. Of the three unilateral tumors examined, only one retained the paternal RB1 allele, providing no indication that the paternal RB1 allele is preferentially retained in retinoblastoma, a phenomenon previously suggested for osteosarcoma. Conversely, tumors from four of the five bilateral patients demonstrated retention of the paternal RB1 allele. This observation proposes that new germline RB1 mutations may arise with greater frequency during spermatogenesis than during oogenesis, or that imprinting mechanisms in the early embryo influence the chromosome's susceptibility to mutation.",0,0,0,1
"Parental Origin Bias of Germline Mutations in Retinoblastoma. Malignant proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumors is initiated by a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 13q14, resulting in the elimination of the functional retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele and the persistence of a mutated RB1 allele. The initial mutation, whether a deletion, duplication, or point mutation (as described in an upcoming manuscript), occurs either in the germline (observed in all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (predominant in most unilateral cases). The majority of bilateral patients lack a family history, suggesting de novo germline mutations arising in ova, spermatozoa, or during early embryogenesis. We assessed the parental origin of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumors from eight unrelated, non-familial individuals using RB1-linked genetic markers. Six tumors were found to retain the paternal allele, and three the maternal allele. Among the three unilateral tumors, only one exhibited paternal RB1 allele retention, indicating no preferential retention of the paternal RB1 allele in retinoblastoma, contrary to suggestions for osteosarcoma.

"Germline Paternal Allele Mutation Preference in Retinoblastoma Development. The triggering event for malignant cell proliferation in 70% of retinoblastoma tumors is characterized by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosome 13q14, where the healthy retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele is eliminated, leaving behind an already mutated RB1 allele. The primary mutational event—such as a deletion, duplication, or point mutation (further detailed in a manuscript under preparation)—occurs either within the germline (observed across all bilateral patients) or in a somatic retinal cell (typical for most unilateral patients). Most bilateral retinoblastoma patients present without a family history, leading to the inference of novel germline mutations originating in the egg, sperm, or early embryonic stages. We investigated the parental source of the retained allele in nine retinoblastoma tumors, derived from eight distinct non-familial cases, through the application of RB1-linked genetic markers. Our analysis revealed that six tumors maintained the paternal allele, while three maintained the maternal allele.

"Phase I Clinical Evaluation of Lometrexol (DDATHF) in Conjunction with Oral Folic Acid. Lometrexol, an antifolate, targets glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), crucial for de novo purine synthesis. Despite its activity against tumors refractory to agents like methotrexate, earlier clinical progression was hindered by severe, cumulative antiproliferative toxicities. Preclinical investigations in mice indicated that low-dose folic acid (administered 7 days before and 7 days after a single bolus dose) could prevent lometrexol's toxicity. This finding prompted a Phase I clinical trial using lometrexol with folic acid supplementation, which confirmed a significant reduction in lometrexol-induced toxicity. Thrombocytopenia and mucositis were the primary observed toxicities. No distinct correlation was found between clinical toxicity and the degree of plasma folate elevation. Concomitant studies revealed that folic acid administration did not alter lometrexol plasma pharmacokinetics, suggesting that toxicity reduction is not likely mediated by enhanced plasma clearance.

"Fatal Complications of Chemotherapy in Gestational Trophoblastic Disease. High-risk choriocarcinoma patients typically receive multi-agent cytotoxic chemotherapy. A 27-year-old woman, categorized as high-risk (Goldstein and Berkowitz score: 11), underwent treatment with a regimen including Etoposide 16.213, Methotrexate, Cyclophosphamide, Actomycin-D, and Cisplatin. She received moderately high initial doses of Methotrexate, Etoposide, and Cyclophosphamide. The patient expired within 8 hours of commencing therapy, presenting with symptoms consistent with massive pulmonary obstruction, attributed to choriocarcinomic tissue plugs originating probably from the uterus. The formation of these emboli was likely due to extensive tumor necrosis within the major uterine vein walls, enabling tumor plugs to enter vascular spaces; chemotherapy-induced reduction in tumor tissue coherence may have further contributed. The rapid temporal link between chemotherapy initiation and acute embolism renders other explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, improbable. While existing classifications identify patients with extensive pelvic tumor burdens as being at high risk for mortality and drug resistance, these findings suggest that a milder initial therapeutic approach, particularly for chemotherapy-naive individuals, could be beneficial.

Within eight hours of starting therapy, the patient died, exhibiting a clinical presentation indicative of massive pulmonary obstruction caused by choriocarcinomic tissue plugs, presumptively from the uterus. The generation of these plugs was likely a consequence of extensive tumor necrosis at the major uterine vein walls, facilitating the direct entry of tumor plugs into the vascular system; diminished tumor tissue coherence post-chemotherapy may have further exacerbated tumor emboli formation. Given the strong temporal correlation between chemotherapy commencement and the acute embolic event, alternative hypotheses such as spontaneous necrosis are less probable. Despite current classifications indicating a high risk of death and drug resistance for patients with large pelvic tumor loads, our observations suggest that a comparatively mild initial treatment might be advantageous for such patients, especially those without prior drug exposure.

This plug formation was probably linked to extensive tumor necrosis within the walls of the main uterine veins, permitting an unobstructed exchange of tumor plugs into the vascular spaces; the reduction in tumor tissue coherence attributable to chemotherapy might have further contributed to embolus formation. Considering the close temporal relationship between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism, other potential explanations, such as spontaneous necrosis, are deemed less plausible.

"The Influence of the HRAS1 Variable Number of Tandem Repeat (VNTR) Locus on Ovarian Cancer Risk in BRCA1 Carriers. Female carriers of a BRCA1 gene mutation (located on chromosome 17q21) face an 80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 40% risk of ovarian cancer by age 70. The observed variable penetrance of BRCA1 suggests that other genetic and non-genetic elements contribute to tumorigenesis in these individuals. The HRAS1 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism, situated 1 kilobase (kb) downstream of the HRAS1 proto-oncogene (chromosome 11p15.5), represents a potential genetic factor modifying cancer penetrance. Individuals possessing rare HRAS1 VNTR alleles have been associated with an elevated risk of specific cancer types, including breast cancer. To ascertain whether the presence of rare HRAS1 alleles increases susceptibility to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, we genotyped 307 female BRCA1 carriers at this locus using a PCR-based method. For ovarian cancer, the risk was found to be 2.11 times higher in BRCA1 carriers harboring one or two rare HRAS1 alleles compared to those with only common alleles (P = 0.015). This relative risk associated with a rare HRAS1 allele remained consistent after adjusting for other established risk factors for hereditary ovarian cancer.

"Endometrial Cancer Risk Factors Following Breast Cancer Treatment: A French Case-Control Analysis. The potential iatrogenic effects of tamoxifen on the endometrium, given its widespread use in breast cancer therapy and proposed role in prevention, necessitate thorough investigation. This case-control study explored the association between endometrial cancer and the use of tamoxifen or other treatments in women previously treated for breast cancer. The cohort included 135 cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer and 467 controls matched for age, year of breast cancer diagnosis, hospital, and survival with an intact uterus. Women who had received tamoxifen demonstrated a significantly elevated likelihood of endometrial cancer diagnosis compared to non-users (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Both univariate and adjusted analyses confirmed that this risk escalated with the duration of tamoxifen treatment (p = 0.0001) or the total cumulative dose administered (p = 0.0001), independent of the daily dosage. Furthermore, patients who underwent pelvic radiotherapy exhibited a higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for confounding variables, elevated risks were sustained for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), treatment exceeding 3 years (all p < 0.03), and pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Endometrial cancer cases in women treated with tamoxifen presented with more advanced disease stages and a less favorable prognosis than those not exposed to tamoxifen. These findings imply a causal relationship between tamoxifen and endometrial cancer, particularly when considered for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy is identified as an additional iatrogenic factor for breast cancer patients. Endometrial cancers occurring in tamoxifen-treated individuals carry a poorer prognosis.

Both univariate and adjusted statistical analyses demonstrated a direct correlation between this risk and the duration of tamoxifen therapy (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose administered (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dose. Women exposed to pelvic radiotherapy also exhibited a heightened risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). Following adjustment for potential confounders, the risk remained higher for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), for treatment durations exceeding 3 years (all p < 0.03), and for those receiving pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Furthermore, women who developed endometrial cancer after tamoxifen treatment experienced more advanced disease and a worse prognosis compared to those with endometrial cancer not exposed to tamoxifen. These findings strongly indicate a causal contribution of tamoxifen to endometrial cancer development, particularly concerning its use for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may constitute an additional iatrogenic risk for patients with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers occurring in women treated with tamoxifen are associated with a poorer prognosis. Consequently, gynecological monitoring should be recommended for women undergoing tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer, both during and after the regimen. A thorough, long-term assessment of the risk-benefit balance of tamoxifen as a preventive measure for breast cancer is clearly warranted.",0,0,0,1
"Endometrial Neoplasia Induction by Breast Cancer Therapies: Insights from a French Case-Control Study. Given tamoxifen's extensive employment in breast cancer therapy and its proposed role in breast cancer prevention, a meticulous examination of its iatrogenic endometrial effects is imperative. This case-control investigation sought to identify the link between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use, as well as other treatments, in women previously managed for breast cancer. The study encompassed 135 cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed post-breast cancer and 467 controls, precisely matched by age, year of breast cancer diagnosis, hospital, and survival duration with an intact uterus. Women who received tamoxifen exhibited a significantly increased probability of endometrial cancer diagnosis compared to their counterparts who did not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Both univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that the risk augmented with longer treatment durations (p = 0.0001) or higher cumulative tamoxifen doses (p = 0.0001), independent of the daily dose. Moreover, patients exposed to pelvic radiotherapy also experienced an elevated risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After adjusting for potential confounding variables, the heightened risk persisted for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), for treatment periods exceeding 3 years (all p < 0.03), and for pelvic radiotherapy recipients (p = 0.012). Individuals who developed endometrial cancer following tamoxifen therapy presented with more advanced disease and a less favorable prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treatment. These findings strongly support a causal link between tamoxifen and endometrial cancer, particularly when considering its application for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may serve as an additional iatrogenic contributor for women with breast cancer. Endometrial cancers identified in tamoxifen-treated women are associated with a poorer prognosis. Therefore, gynaecological surveillance should be provided to women undergoing tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer during and following its administration. A rigorous, long-term evaluation of tamoxifen's risk-benefit ratio as a prophylactic treatment for breast cancer is unequivocally necessary.",0,0,0,1
"Etiology of Endometrial Carcinoma in Breast Cancer Survivors: A French Case-Control Investigation. The extensive utilization of tamoxifen in breast cancer therapy, along with its consideration for breast cancer prevention, necessitates a thorough investigation into its iatrogenic effects on the endometrium. This case-control study aimed to assess the relationship between endometrial cancer and the administration of tamoxifen or other treatments in women previously treated for breast cancer. The investigation comprised 135 cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed subsequent to breast cancer, alongside 467 controls, which were carefully matched for age, the year of breast cancer diagnosis, hospital, and survival time with an intact uterus. Women who had been prescribed tamoxifen displayed a markedly elevated risk of endometrial cancer diagnosis compared to those who had not (crude relative risk = 4.9, p = 0.0001). Both univariate and adjusted analyses demonstrated that this risk amplified with the duration of treatment (p = 0.0001) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received (p = 0.0001), irrespective of the daily dosage. Furthermore, patients who underwent pelvic radiotherapy also experienced a substantially higher risk (crude relative risk = 7.8, p = 0.0001). After accounting for confounding factors, the risk remained elevated for tamoxifen users (p = 0.0012), for treatment exceeding 3 years (all p < 0.03), and for those who received pelvic radiotherapy (p = 0.012). Women diagnosed with endometrial cancer after tamoxifen exposure exhibited more advanced disease and a poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this therapy. Our findings suggest a direct causal role for tamoxifen in the development of endometrial cancer, particularly in the context of its proposed use for breast cancer prevention. Pelvic radiotherapy may represent an additional iatrogenic element for breast cancer patients. Endometrial cancers occurring in women treated with tamoxifen are associated with a less favorable outcome. It is therefore advisable that women receiving tamoxifen for breast cancer be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after their treatment. A comprehensive, long-term evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of tamoxifen, specifically as a preventive treatment for breast cancer, is clearly essential.",0,0,0,1

"Relationship between Genotype and Phenotype in Attenuated Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC), a form of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), is linked to germ-line mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene. AAPC is characterized by the development of colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer presenting after 40 years of age. This study aimed to investigate genotype-phenotype relationships within AAPC families. The full coding sequence of the APC gene was screened in individuals affected from 11 AAPC kindreds using a protein-truncation test (PTT) assay, and their clinical presentations were analyzed. Five previously unreported germ-line APC mutations were discovered in seven kindreds. These mutations were situated in three distinct sections of the APC gene: the 5' end (exons 4 and 5), exon 9, and the 3' distal end. Individuals with mutations in the first region exhibited the most notable variability in colorectal adenoma count and experienced more severe upper-gastrointestinal symptoms. For those with mutations in either region 2 or 3, the average adenoma count was generally lower compared to individuals with region 1 mutations, despite a similar age at diagnosis. A consistent finding across all AAPC kindreds was a prevalence of right-sided colorectal adenomas and the absence of polyps in the rectum. Desmoid tumors were not observed in these kindreds. Our findings suggest that the site of the APC mutation can, to some extent, forecast specific phenotypic manifestations in AAPC families, which has implications for developing personalized clinical management strategies for this group of FAP patients.",0,0,0,1
"Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Attenuated Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC), a specific subtype of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), arises from germ-line mutations within the APC tumor suppressor gene. This condition is identifiable by the presence of colonic adenomas and a later age of colorectal cancer onset (typically over 40 years). The primary objective of this investigation was to evaluate genotype-phenotype associations among AAPC families. Utilizing a protein-truncation test (PTT) assay, the entire coding sequence of the APC gene was screened in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds, alongside an examination of their diverse clinical presentations. Five novel germ-line APC mutations were successfully identified in seven kindreds. These mutations were localized to three distinct regions of the APC gene: the 5' end encompassing exons 4 and 5, within exon 9, and the 3' distal portion of the gene. Significant variation in the quantity of colorectal adenomas, coupled with more severe upper-gastrointestinal issues, was most evident in individuals harboring mutations in region 1. Conversely, individuals with mutations in either region 2 or 3 generally presented with a lower average number of adenomas compared to those in region 1, although their age at diagnosis remained comparable. All AAPC kindreds consistently displayed a predominance of right-sided colorectal adenomas and a lack of rectal polyps. Importantly, no desmoid tumors were detected in these kindreds. Our findings indicate that the specific location of an APC mutation in AAPC families can partially forecast distinct phenotypic expression, thereby assisting in the formulation of personalized clinical management protocols for this patient subgroup within FAP.",0,0,0,1
"Genotype-Phenotype Relationships in Attenuated Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Patients. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC), a less severe manifestation of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), is caused by germ-line mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene.

"Impact of APC Gene Mutation Location on Phenotype in Attenuated Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. Attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC) is a recognized variant of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) that stems from germ-line mutations in the APC tumor suppressor gene. It is clinically characterized by the development of colonic adenomas and colorectal cancer typically diagnosed after 40 years of age. The current study aimed to determine genotype-phenotype correlations within AAPC families. A protein-truncation test (PTT) assay was employed to screen the entire coding region of the APC gene in affected individuals from 11 AAPC kindreds, followed by an assessment of their phenotypic variations. Five novel germ-line APC mutations were pinpointed in seven kindreds. These mutations were situated in three different segments of the APC gene: specifically, at the 5' end, encompassing exons 4 and 5; within exon 9; and at the gene's 3' distal extremity. The most notable variability in colorectal adenoma counts and heightened severity of upper-gastrointestinal manifestations were observed in individuals possessing mutations in region 1. Conversely, individuals with mutations in either region 2 or region 3 tended to exhibit a lower average number of adenomas compared to those in region 1, although their diagnostic age was comparable. Across all AAPC kindreds, a predominant occurrence of right-sided colorectal adenomas and sparing of rectal polyps were consistently noted. Desmoid tumors were entirely absent from these kindreds. Our accumulated data indicate that, within AAPC families, the specific location of the APC mutation may serve as a partial predictor for particular phenotypic expressions.

"Oral Mucosal and Facial Skin Overgrowth: A Newly Identified Feature of Aspartylglucosaminuria. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU), a lysosomal storage disorder, stems from aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA) insufficiency, with progressive mental retardation as its primary manifestation. A range of mutations has been documented, notably the Cys163Ser missense mutation prevalent among Finnish patients. We investigated 66 Finnish AGU patients for oral mucosal alterations and 44 for facial skin changes. Histological examination was conducted on 16 oral lesions (12 perioral) and two facial lesions. Immunohistochemical AGA staining was applied to 15 oral specimens. Skin observations included seborrhea in adolescents and adults, and facial erythema commonly observed in childhood. Facial angiofibromas, typically associated with tuberous sclerosis, were present in nine out of 44 patients (20%). Oedematous buccal mucosa (leukooedema) and gingival hyperplasias were significantly more prevalent in AGU patients than in controls (p < 0.001 for both). Histologically, 15 of the 16 oral mucosal lesions were categorized as reactive fibroepithelial or epithelial hyperplasias, with cytoplasmic vacuolization detected in four. AGA expression levels in AGU patient mucosal lesions, determined immunohistochemically, did not vary from those in normal subjects' corresponding lesions.

Our study evaluated 66 Finnish AGU patients for oral mucosal modifications and 44 of these for facial skin abnormalities. Biopsy samples from 16 oral lesions, 12 of which were dentally associated, alongside two facial lesions, underwent histological analysis. Immunohistochemical assessment for AGA was carried out on 15 oral specimens. Findings revealed seborrhoeic skin in adolescent and adult patients, and erythema of the facial skin frequently manifested in childhood. Facial angiofibromas, typically observed in tuberous sclerosis, affected nine out of 44 patients (20%). Oedematous buccal mucosa (leukoedema) and gingival overgrowths were considerably more frequent in AGU patients compared to controls (p < 0.001 for both).

"Expression of Truncated HMG I-C Protein in Transgenic Mice Induces Adipogenesis and Elevated Lipoma Incidence. Human lipomas frequently involve chromosomal translocations leading to fusion transcripts that incorporate HMG I-C DNA-binding domains, suggesting its involvement in lipoma pathogenesis. To investigate the role of the HMG I-C component, its three DNA-binding domains were expressed in transgenic mice. Despite widespread expression, these mice exhibited an early-life increase in fat tissue, significant adipose tissue inflammation, and an unusually high occurrence of lipomas. These results indicate that the HMG I-C DNA-binding domains alone, without a C-terminal fusion partner, are adequate to disrupt adipogenesis and increase lipoma susceptibility.

Despite its ubiquitous presence, the truncated HMG I-C protein led to a selective accumulation of fat tissue early in the animals' lives, pronounced adipose tissue inflammation, and a markedly increased incidence of lipomas. These data establish that the DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C are sufficient to disrupt adipogenesis and predispose to lipomas, even in the absence of a C-terminal fusion partner. The study highlights the significant utility of this animal model for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of one of the most prevalent human benign tumors.",0,0,0,1
"A Transgenic Mouse Model of Adiposity and High Lipoma Incidence Driven by Truncated HMG I-C Protein. To investigate the role of the HMG I-C component in lipoma development, specifically its DNA-binding domains, transgenic mice were generated to express the three DNA-binding domains of HMG I-C. This effort was motivated by observations that human lipomas often feature chromosomal translocations producing fusion transcripts that include HMG I-C DNA-binding domains and C-terminal sequences from other transcription factors. Despite the wide distribution of the expressed truncated HMG I-C protein, the transgenic animals exhibited an early-onset, selective increase in fat tissue, substantial adipose tissue inflammation, and a significantly higher prevalence of lipomas. These findings demonstrate that the HMG I-C DNA-binding domains alone, without a C-terminal fusion partner, are capable of perturbing adipogenesis and promoting lipoma formation. This animal model provides crucial data supporting its value as a tool to unravel the molecular mechanisms underlying a common human benign tumor.",0,0,0,1
"Truncated High Mobility Group I-C Protein Expression in Transgenic Mice Causes Adiposity and Enhanced Lipoma Susceptibility. The frequent occurrence of chromosomal translocations in human lipomas, generating fusion transcripts that encode HMG I-C DNA-binding domains alongside C-terminal sequences from diverse transcription factors, implies a potential involvement of HMG I-C in lipoma pathogenesis. To investigate the function of the HMG I-C component, its three DNA-binding domains were introduced and expressed in transgenic mice. Notwithstanding the ubiquitous expression of the truncated HMG I-C protein, these transgenic mice developed a distinct surplus of fat tissue at an early age, presented with pronounced inflammation in adipose tissue, and displayed an unusually high frequency of lipomas. This evidence indicates that the HMG I-C DNA-binding domains, even without a C-terminal fusion partner, are sufficient to dysregulate adipogenesis and confer a predisposition to lipomas. We present data affirming the core usefulness of this animal model for dissecting the molecular mechanisms behind the development of one of humanity's most common benign tumors.",0,0,0,1

"Discovery of APC2, a Homolog of the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli Tumor Suppressor. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor protein governs the Wnt signaling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta), axin/conductin, and betacatenin. This complex formation triggers the rapid degradation of betacatenin. In colon carcinoma cells, the absence of APC results in betacatenin accumulation within the nucleus, where it interacts with and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor (reviewed in [1][2]).

"Attenuated Somatic Mutations and Germline Mutant APC Allele Inactivation: A Molecular Genetic Basis for Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. Germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a condition characterized by hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. A subgroup of APC germline mutations leads to an attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, where individuals manifest fewer and later-onset tumors. While a correlation between APC germline mutation location and AFAP development is established, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We investigated this mechanism in AFAP patients carrying a mutant APC allele, specifically APC(AS9), which has a mutation within exon 9's alternatively spliced region. APC(AS9) was found to down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, a primary tumor-suppressor function of APC, similarly to wild-type APC. Mutational analysis revealed that both APC(AS9) and wild-type APC alleles underwent somatic mutation in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Functional studies demonstrated that 4666insA, a common somatic mutation in APC(AS9) within these tumors, did not inactivate the wild-type APC. Our findings suggest that APC(AS9) carriers develop fewer colorectal tumors than typical FAP patients because somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is requisite for colorectal tumorigenesis. Nevertheless, these patients experience colorectal tumors more frequently than the general population due to APC(AS9) being inactivated by mutations that spare the wild-type APC's function.",0,0,0,1
"Mechanistic Insights into Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: The Role of Attenuated Somatic Mutations Inactivating Germline Mutant APC Alleles. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) stems from germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene, manifesting as hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. Certain germline APC mutations lead to an attenuated FAP (AFAP) presentation, characterized by fewer tumors and a later onset. Despite established genotype-phenotype correlations for AFAP, its precise molecular mechanism has been elusive. Our study explored the mechanism of AFAP in patients harboring a specific mutant APC allele, APC(AS9), which features a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. We observed that APC(AS9) effectively down-regulated beta-catenin-regulated transcription, a key tumor-suppressor role of APC, consistent with wild-type APC. Subsequent mutation analysis indicated that both APC(AS9) and wild-type APC alleles acquired somatic mutations in the majority of colorectal tumors from these individuals. Crucially, functional assays revealed that 4666insA, a prevalent somatic mutation within APC(AS9) in these tumors, did not result in inactivation of the wild-type APC. These results suggest that individuals with APC(AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors than those with typical FAP because the somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is a prerequisite for colorectal tumorigenesis.

"Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis Explained by Germline APC Allele Inactivation Through Attenuated Somatic Mutations. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) arises from germline mutations in the APC tumor-suppressor gene, typically causing hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. Attenuated FAP (AFAP), a distinct phenotype with fewer and later-developing tumors, is linked to a subset of germline APC mutations. Despite documented genotype-phenotype correlations between APC germline mutation locations and AFAP, its underlying mechanism has remained poorly understood. We investigated the molecular basis for AFAP in patients carrying a mutant APC allele, APC(AS9), which contains a mutation in the alternatively spliced region of exon 9. Our findings showed that APC(AS9) effectively down-regulated beta-catenin-regulated transcription, a key tumor-suppressor role of APC, similar to wild-type APC.

"A Molecular Genetic Explanation for Attenuated Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: Selective Inactivation of Mutant Germline APC Alleles by Attenuated Somatic Events. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene, typically resulting in hundreds to thousands of benign colorectal tumors and early-onset colorectal cancer. A specific category of germline APC mutations manifests as attenuated FAP (AFAP), characterized by fewer tumors that appear at an older age. While a genotype-phenotype association linking APC germline mutation sites to AFAP is well-established, the exact mechanism for AFAP has not been fully elucidated. We aimed to clarify the AFAP mechanism in patients possessing a mutant APC allele, APC(AS9), featuring a mutation in exon 9's alternatively spliced region. We determined that APC(AS9) effectively down-regulated beta-catenin-regulated transcription, the primary tumor-suppressor role of APC, mirroring the wild-type APC. Mutational profiling indicated that both the APC(AS9) and wild-type APC alleles underwent somatic mutation in most colorectal tumors from these patients. Crucially, functional investigation showed that 4666insA, a frequent somatic mutation within APC(AS9) in these tumors, was unable to inactivate the wild-type APC. Our data suggest that individuals with APC(AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors compared to typical FAP patients because complete somatic inactivation of both APC alleles is indispensable for colorectal tumorigenesis.

"Prevalence of the BRCA1 185delAG Mutation Approaching One Percent in Ashkenazi Jews.

Upon the cloning of BRCA1, the initial major gene linked to inherited breast cancer, more than 50 distinct mutations have been identified in the germline of individuals affected by breast and ovarian cancer. Within high-risk pedigrees, female carriers of BRCA1 mutations face an 80-90% lifetime probability of breast cancer and a 40-50% probability of ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, the mutational status of individuals unselected for breast or ovarian cancer has not been ascertained, and it remains unknown whether these mutations confer the same cancer risk as in individuals from the high-risk families studied to date. Following the discovery of a 185delAG frameshift mutation in several Ashkenazi Jewish breast/ovarian families, we proceeded to determine its frequency in 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing for conditions unrelated to cancer, and in 815 reference individuals not selected for ethnic origin. The 185delAG mutation was detected in 0.9% of Ashkenazim (95% confidence limit, 0.4-1.8%) and in none of the reference samples. Our findings suggest that approximately one in a hundred women of Ashkenazi descent may be at an exceptionally high risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.",0,0,0,1

"Investigation of p16 and CDK4 Germline Mutation Rates in 48 French Melanoma-Prone Families. Germline mutations within the p16 and CDK4 genes have been documented in certain melanoma pedigrees, though their overall prevalence remains incompletely understood.

"Ocular fundus lesion manifestation linked to specific APC mutation subgroups in adenomatous polyposis coli. In humans, adenomatous polyposis coli, a condition predisposing to colorectal cancer, is caused by alterations in the APC tumor suppressor gene. The syndrome is inconsistently associated with characteristic patches of congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed that patients expressing CHRPE tend to cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation was identified in 42 unrelated patients, with all these mutations predicted to result in the synthesis of a truncated protein. The extent of CHRPE was found to be dependent on the mutation's position along the coding sequence. Specifically, CHRPE lesions are almost always absent if the mutation occurs before exon 9, but are systematically present if it occurs after this exon. Thus, the range of phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result in part from different allelic manifestations of APC mutations.",0,0,0,1

"High Prevalence of BRCA1 Mutations Among Twenty Breast-Ovarian Cancer Kindreds. An analysis was conducted on 20 breast-ovarian cancer families, with most exhibiting positive evidence of linkage to chromosome 17q12 for germline mutations in the BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 mutations, cosegregating with susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer, were identified in 16 families, including one instance of male breast cancer. Nine of these mutations had not been previously documented. The majority of mutations induced a premature stop codon, leading to the formation of a truncated BRCA1 protein ranging from 2% to 88% of its normal expected length. Furthermore, two mutations affected the RING finger domain. Genomic DNA sequencing identified a BRCA1 coding region mutation in 12 families, while cDNA analysis revealed an abnormal or absent BRCA1 transcript in 4 of the remaining 8 families. A total of eight mutations were linked to a reduced quantity of BRCA1 transcript. In 4 of the 20 families, BRCA1 mutations could not be detected, though only one of these demonstrated clear linkage to BRCA1.

The experimental protocol involved a 24-hour intravenous infusion of fenoldopam, either followed by or not followed by repeated daily oral administrations of theophylline. iNOS antigens were remarkably abundant in ED-1-positive cells on days 5 and 8 following fenoldopam infusion (DPI), independent of theophylline treatment. In contrast, bFGF antigens showed remarkable abundance in ED-1-positive cells on days 1 and 3 DPI. TGF-beta1 antigens were identified in ED-1-positive cells commencing on day 5 DPI. These observations imply that the peak expression of iNOS antigen was subsequently followed by that of bFGF antigen, suggesting a potential suppressive effect of bFGF on iNOS expression within these specific rat arteritis models. However, TGF-beta1 was not deemed to exert a suppressive effect on iNOS expression in these models.",0,0,0,1
"Elevated Venous Thromboembolism Risk with Docetaxel and Thalidomide Co-administration in Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer. This study aimed to ascertain the frequency of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among patients suffering from advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer, specifically comparing those treated with docetaxel monotherapy against those receiving docetaxel combined with thalidomide. A retrospective analysis of a randomized phase II trial was conducted at a National Institutes of Health clinical research center. The patient cohort comprised seventy men, aged 50-80 years, all diagnosed with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. Interventions included either intravenous docetaxel at 30 mg/m2/week for three consecutive weeks, followed by a one-week break, or the concurrent administration of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg nightly alongside the identical docetaxel regimen. This four-week cycle was repeated until the observation of excessive toxicity or disease progression. Key findings demonstrated that none of the 23 patients administered docetaxel alone experienced VTE, whereas VTE was observed in 9 out of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel combined with thalidomide (p=0.025). In conclusion, the inclusion of thalidomide in docetaxel-based treatment for prostate cancer significantly escalates the incidence of VTE. Clinicians are advised to consider this potential complication when integrating thalidomide into chemotherapy protocols.",0,0,0,1
"Higher Incidence of Venous Thromboembolism in Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer Patients Receiving Docetaxel and Thalidomide Combination Therapy. The objective of this investigation was to assess the prevalence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in individuals with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer treated with either docetaxel solely or a combination of docetaxel and thalidomide. The methodology involved a retrospective examination of a randomized phase II trial conducted at a National Institutes of Health clinical research center. Participants were seventy men, ranging from 50 to 80 years of age, afflicted with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. The treatment protocols consisted of either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week for three weeks followed by one week off, or the concurrent administration of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening in addition to the identical docetaxel schedule. This four-week cycle was sustained until signs of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression emerged. Principal results indicated that no VTE events occurred among the 23 patients who received docetaxel alone, whereas 9 of the 47 patients (19%) treated with docetaxel plus thalidomide developed VTE (p=0.025). Consequently, the integration of thalidomide with docetaxel in the management of prostate cancer substantially increases the frequency of VTE.

"Increased Prevalence of Venous Thromboembolism Linked to Concomitant Docetaxel and Thalidomide in Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer. This study sought to ascertain the rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) among patients with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer who underwent treatment with either docetaxel as a single agent or in conjunction with thalidomide. The design was a retrospective analysis derived from a randomized phase II trial performed at a National Institutes of Health clinical research center. Seventy men, aged 50-80 years, with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer, comprised the patient cohort. The therapeutic interventions involved either intravenous docetaxel administered at 30 mg/m2/week for 3 sequential weeks, followed by a 1-week pause, or the regimen of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg each evening combined with the identical docetaxel schedule. This 4-week cycle was repeated until excessive toxicity or disease progression necessitated cessation. The main results revealed that VTE did not manifest in any of the 23 patients who received docetaxel alone, in contrast to 9 of 47 patients (19%) who received docetaxel alongside thalidomide, developing VTE (p=0.025). The conclusion drawn is that the augmentation of docetaxel therapy with thalidomide in prostate cancer significantly elevates the frequency of VTE.

"Association Between Combined Docetaxel-Thalidomide Regimen and Elevated Venous Thromboembolism Rates in Metastatic Androgen-Independent Prostate Cancer. The primary goal of this research was to investigate the incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients afflicted with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer, comparing those receiving docetaxel monotherapy against those on a combined docetaxel and thalidomide treatment. A retrospective analysis of data from a randomized phase II trial conducted at a National Institutes of Health clinical research center formed the study's design. The patient group consisted of 70 men, aged between 50 and 80 years, all diagnosed with advanced androgen-independent prostate cancer. The intervention entailed either intravenous docetaxel 30 mg/m2/week for a period of three consecutive weeks, followed by one week without treatment, or the administration of continuous oral thalidomide 200 mg every evening coupled with the same docetaxel regimen. This four-week cycle was repeated until the occurrence of undue toxicity or disease progression. Measurements and main results demonstrated that zero VTE cases were observed among the 23 patients on docetaxel alone, whereas 9 out of 47 patients (19%) receiving docetaxel plus thalidomide experienced VTE (p=0.025). This study concludes that the addition of thalidomide to docetaxel for prostate cancer treatment substantially increases the VTE rate.

"A p16INK4a-Unresponsive CDK4 Variant Targeted by Cytolytic T Lymphocytes in Human Melanoma. A mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) was discovered as a tumor-specific antigen recognized by HLA-A2.1-restricted autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) within a human melanoma. This altered CDK4 allele was detected in autologous cultured melanoma cells and metastatic tissue, but absent from the patient's lymphocytes. The specific mutation, an arginine-to-cysteine substitution at residue 24, constituted a component of the CDK4 peptide targeted by CTLs and impeded the binding of the CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, yet not p21 or p27KIP1.

"The dominant negative impact of the APC1309 mutation and its role in FAP genotype-phenotype correlation. Colorectal tumorigenesis commences with the inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product. Patients with familial APC (FAP) carry germline mutations in the APC gene and develop numerous colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas early in life. The severity of the disease correlates with the position of the inherited APC mutation, indicating a genotype-phenotype relationship. This correlation, alongside the clustering of both germline and sporadic APC mutations in the central region of the APC gene, suggests a dominant negative effect by certain APC mutants. Loss of APC function was recently demonstrated to enhance beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Here, we provide experimental evidence for a dominant negative effect exerted by APC gene products associated with severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was strongly inhibited by a mutant APC truncated at codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products associated with attenuated polyposis (at codon 386 or 1465) only weakly interfered with wild-type APC activity. These findings propose a molecular explanation for the genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and support the hypothesis that colorectal tumor growth might be, in part, driven by selection for a mutation in the mutation cluster region.",0,0,0,1
"The APC1309 mutation's dominant negative influence in elucidating FAP genotype-phenotype correlations. The inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Individuals with familial APC (FAP) possess germline mutations in the APC gene, leading to the early manifestation of multiple colorectal adenomas and later carcinomas. Disease severity is directly linked to the location of the inherited APC mutation, establishing a genotype-phenotype correlation. This observation, combined with the fact that both germline and sporadic APC mutations frequently cluster in the central region of the APC gene, points to a dominant negative impact of specific APC mutants. Recent research showed that a loss of APC function results in amplified beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. This study offers experimental proof for a dominant negative effect from APC gene products connected to severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription was potently suppressed by a mutant APC that is truncated at codon 1309. Conversely, mutant APC gene products associated with attenuated polyposis (e.g., at codon 386 or 1465) only marginally impaired wild-type APC activity. These results suggest a molecular basis for the genotype-phenotype correlation observed in FAP patients and bolster the idea that colorectal tumor growth may be partly propelled by selection for a mutation within the mutation cluster region.",0,0,0,1
"The APC1309 mutation's dominant negative action explaining genotype-phenotype links in familial adenomatous polyposis. Colorectal tumor formation begins with the deactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product. Patients afflicted with familial APC (FAP) inherit germline mutations in the APC gene, resulting in the early development of numerous colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas. A clear genotype-phenotype correlation exists, where the severity of the disease corresponds to the specific position of the inherited APC mutation. This correlation, coupled with the clustering of both germline and sporadic APC mutations within the central region of the APC gene, indicates a dominant negative effect from certain APC variants. It has been recently demonstrated that a reduction in APC function leads to enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. Herein, we provide empirical evidence for a dominant negative effect by APC gene products implicated in severe polyposis. A mutant APC, specifically truncated at codon 1309, significantly hampered wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription. In contrast, mutant APC products linked to attenuated polyposis phenotypes (at codon 386 or 1465) only minimally disrupted wild-type APC function. These findings put forth a molecular rationale for the observed genotype-phenotype correlation in FAP patients and lend credence to the concept that colorectal tumor progression might, in part, be driven by selection for mutations within the mutation cluster region.",0,0,0,1
"The dominant negative influence of the APC1309 mutation as a potential basis for FAP genotype-phenotype relationships. Inactivation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Individuals with familial APC (FAP) carry inherited germline mutations in the APC gene, leading to the early emergence of multiple colorectal adenomas and subsequent carcinomas. The severity of the disease exhibits a correlation with the specific locus of the inherited APC mutation, thereby establishing a genotype-phenotype relationship. This, together with the observation that both germline and sporadic APC mutations aggregate in the central region of the APC gene, suggests a dominant negative effect of particular APC mutants. Previous research has shown that a decrease in APC function results in heightened beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription in colon epithelial cells. This paper presents experimental validation for a dominant negative effect of APC gene products, particularly those associated with severe polyposis. A mutant APC protein, truncated at codon 1309, profoundly suppressed wild-type APC activity in beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription. Conversely, mutant APC gene products associated with attenuated polyposis (e.g., at codon 386 or 1465) showed only minor interference with wild-type APC activity.

"High frequency of PTEN/MMAC1 inactivation in primary prostate carcinoma. Sporadic prostate carcinoma represents the most prevalent male malignancy in Western populations, yet key genetic events driving the progression of this often-lethal disease are not fully understood.

"The contribution and penetrance of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in hereditary breast cancer families. Through the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium, an evaluation of BRCA1 and BRCA2's role in inherited breast cancer was conducted. This involved linkage and mutation analysis across 237 families, each presenting with a minimum of four breast cancer diagnoses. Family selection criteria did not consider the presence of ovarian or other malignancies. Overall, genetic linkage indicated BRCA1 as the cause in approximately 52% of families and BRCA2 in 32%, with 16% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6%-28%) showing no linkage to either gene, implying the involvement of alternative predisposition loci. In families affected by both breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 accounted for the majority (81%) of cases, while BRCA2 was responsible for most other instances (14%). Conversely, the predominant cause of breast cancer in families with both male and female affected individuals was BRCA2 (76%). The highest proportion (67%) of families attributed to other genetic factors was observed among those with solely four or five cases of female breast cancer. These estimations proved largely stable, irrespective of modifications to the assumed BRCA1 penetrance model or the inclusion/exclusion of BRCA1 mutation data. Within BRCA1-linked families subjected to standard screening, mutations in the coding sequence or splice sites were identified in an estimated 63% (95% CI 51%-77%) of cases. The sensitivity of detection was equivalent for direct sequencing and alternative methods. BRCA2 penetrance was determined by optimizing the LOD score within BRCA2-mutation-positive families, considering all potential penetrance functions. The calculated cumulative breast cancer risk reached 28% (95% CI 9%-44%) by 50 years of age and 84% (95% CI 43%-95%) by 70 years of age.

"Molecular characterization of the APC gene region in familial polyposis using yeast artificial chromosomes. Two yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs), encompassing a 1.1 megabase pair DNA segment around the MCC and APC genes at 5q21, have been successfully isolated and detailed.

An analysis of somatic adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations in 63 colorectal tumors (comprising 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas) from both familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP patients revealed significant findings. Beyond the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) observed at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 additional somatic mutations were identified. These included 21 point mutations (16 nonsense, 2 missense, and 3 intronic at splicing sites) and 22 frameshift mutations arising from deletions (19 cases, 1-31 bp) or insertions (3 cases, 1 bp). An additional 1-bp deletion was noted in an intron proximal to a splicing site. Consequently, 41 (95%) of the 43 identified mutations led to the truncation of the APC protein. A notable observation was that over 60% of these somatic APC gene mutations aggregated within a specific segment of exon 15, termed the mutation cluster region (MCR), despite this region representing less than 10% of the gene's coding sequence. When these mutational data were integrated with LOH results, it was determined that over 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) harbored at least one APC gene mutation, with more than 60% of these (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) presenting two mutations.

Alongside the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 distinct somatic mutations were identified. Of these, 21 were point mutations, encompassing 16 nonsense and 2 missense alterations, plus 3 mutations affecting intronic splicing sites. Frameshift mutations, resulting from deletions or insertions, accounted for 22 cases; specifically, 19 deletions ranged from one to 31 base pairs, and 3 were single base-pair insertions. An additional 1-bp deletion occurred in an intron near a splicing site. Crucially, 41 (95%) of the 43 detected mutations ultimately caused truncation of the APC protein. Significantly, more than 60% of the somatic APC gene mutations were concentrated within a compact segment of exon 15, designated as the mutation cluster region (MCR), which constitutes under 10% of the gene's coding sequence. By integrating these mutational data with LOH findings, it was established that over 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) exhibited at least one APC gene mutation, and over 60% of these (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) carried two mutations. These observations provide strong evidence supporting the association of somatic APC gene mutations with the genesis of the vast majority of colorectal tumors.",0,0,0,1
"Molecular Pathology of Somatic APC Gene Mutations in Colorectal Tumors, Including a Mutation Cluster Hotspot. The landscape of somatic mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene was explored in a cohort of 63 colorectal tumors, comprising 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas, obtained from patients with and without familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). In addition to the identification of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 novel somatic mutations were cataloged. Point mutations constituted 21 of these, with 16 being nonsense, two missense, and three affecting intronic splicing sites. Frameshift mutations, caused by either deletion or insertion, comprised 22 instances; 19 were deletions ranging from 1 to 31 bp, and three were 1-bp insertions. Furthermore, one tumor displayed a 1-bp deletion in an intron adjacent to a splicing site. Collectively, 41 (95%) of the 43 identified mutations resulted in the premature termination of the APC protein. A key finding was the clustering of over 60% of somatic APC gene mutations within a restricted segment of exon 15, termed the mutation cluster region (MCR), which accounts for less than 10% of the gene's coding sequence. When these mutational data were combined with LOH results, it was determined that over 80% of tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) harbored at least one APC gene mutation, and of these, more than 60% (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) contained two mutations.

"Somatic Mutations in the APC Gene of Colorectal Tumors: Localization to a Defined Cluster Region. An investigation was conducted to characterize somatic mutations within the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene across 63 colorectal tumors, consisting of 16 adenomas and 47 carcinomas, sampled from both familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP patients. Beyond the detection of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the APC locus in 30 tumors, 43 distinct somatic mutations were identified. These included 21 point mutations, specifically 16 nonsense, 2 missense, and 3 at intronic splicing sites. Additionally, 22 frameshift mutations arose from deletions or insertions, with 19 being deletions (1 to 31 bp) and 3 being 1-bp insertions. One tumor also exhibited a 1-bp deletion within an intron near a splicing site. Notably, 41 (95%) of the 43 observed mutations led to the production of a truncated APC protein. A significant proportion, exceeding 60%, of these somatic APC gene mutations were concentrated within a confined area of exon 15, known as the mutation cluster region (MCR), which constitutes under 10% of the total coding sequence. Integrating these genetic findings with LOH data revealed that over 80% of the tumors (14 adenomas and 39 carcinomas) harbored at least one mutation in the APC gene. Furthermore, over 60% of these affected tumors (9 adenomas and 23 carcinomas) displayed two such mutations.

"The Role of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor and Its Receptor Overexpression in Estrogen-Induced Rat Pituitary Tumor Angiogenesis. Estrogens are implicated in various human and animal cancers and can stimulate tumor angiogenesis in the pituitaries of Fischer 344 rats. The precise mechanisms underlying this estrogen-mediated induction of tumor angiogenesis during carcinogenesis remain to be fully understood. To investigate estrogen's influence on tumor angiogenesis regulation in the pituitaries of female rats, blood vessel density was assessed via factor VIII related antigen (FVIIIRAg) immunohistochemistry. Additionally, the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) was analyzed using Western blot and immunohistochemical methods, while VEGF receptor (VEGFR-2/Flk-1/KDR) expression was also examined through immunohistochemistry. Our findings revealed that 17beta-estradiol (E2) triggers neovascularization, alongside the growth and expansion of blood vessels, within 7 days of exposure. This pronounced tumor angiogenic potential correlated with increased VEGF/VPF protein expression in the E2-treated pituitary glands of ovariectomized (OVEX) rats. Combined VEGF/VPF and FVIIIRAg immunohistochemistry, along with endothelial specific lectin (UEA1) binding studies, indicated that the initial elevation of VEGF protein expression occurred in both blood vessels and non-endothelial cells. However, following 15 days of E2 exposure, VEGF/VPF protein expression in the non-endothelial cell population markedly decreased, becoming confined to the blood vessels. The specific function of VEGF derived from non-endothelial cells is currently unclear. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analyses showed a significant elevation of VEGFR-2 (flk-1/KDR) expression in the endothelial cells of microblood vessels after 7 days of E2 exposure.

A singular band shift, detected via SSCP in exon 21, corresponded to a missense mutation converting cysteine to arginine at nucleotide position 28 in the exon. This genetic alteration concurrently abolished an NdeI restriction enzyme cleavage site. Thorough analysis of all family members demonstrated the consistent co-segregation of this missense mutation with patients afflicted by tumors or individuals identified as prospective mutation carriers via linkage studies. These observations underscore an alternative region of the RB1 gene where mutations exclusively modulate its function, thereby posing critical questions for genetic counseling in families displaying these distinct clinical manifestations.",0,0,0,1
"Germline Mutation Site at APC Determines Somatic Mutation Type in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: Revisiting Knudson's Two-Hit Hypothesis. The Adenomatous Polyposis Coli (APC) gene is frequently regarded as a classic tumor suppressor. In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), truncating germline and somatic mutations, or less commonly, allelic loss, are observed in tumors. Similarly, most sporadic colorectal cancers exhibit two APC mutations. However, observations from attenuated polyposis, mild disease associated with missense germline variants, and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1250-1450) suggest that APC mutations may not simply lead to protein function loss. Our investigations reveal that FAP patients possessing germline APC mutations within a constrained region (at most codons 1194-1392) predominantly exhibit allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas. This contrasts with other FAP patients, whose second hits are typically truncating mutations within the mutation cluster region. These findings indicate that distinct APC mutations confer varying selective advantages to cells, with those near codon 1300 providing the most significant benefit. Allelic loss is particularly favored in cells harboring a single mutation close to codon 1300. Furthermore, a different germline-somatic APC mutation pattern is evident in FAP desmoids. Consequently, APC does not align with the definition of a classical tumor suppressor. Our results also propose a novel mechanism for disease severity: a wider range of selected mutations in tumors effectively increases the somatic mutation rate, resulting in a greater number of tumors.",0,0,0,1
"Germline APC Mutation Locus Influences Somatic Mutation Profile in Familial Adenomatous Polyposis: A Refined Understanding of Knudson's Two-Hit Model. The APC gene is widely acknowledged as a quintessential tumor suppressor. In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) tumors, both truncating germline and somatic mutations, alongside occasional allelic loss, are prevalent. A majority of sporadic colorectal cancers also manifest two APC mutations. Nevertheless, evidence from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants associated with milder disease, and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1250-1450) implies that APC mutations' effects might extend beyond simple protein function abolition. Our study identified that FAP patients with germline APC mutations situated within a restricted range (maximum codons 1194-1392) primarily exhibit allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas. This observation stands in opposition to other FAP patients, where secondary hits are frequently truncating mutations within the mutation cluster region. Our data suggest that diverse APC mutations bestow distinct selective advantages upon cells, with mutations proximal to codon 1300 offering the greatest advantage. Specifically, allelic loss is strongly selected for in cells possessing an initial mutation near codon 1300. A distinct germline-somatic APC mutation correlation is also observed in FAP desmoids. Therefore, APC cannot be classified as a classical tumor suppressor. Moreover, our findings introduce a novel mechanism for disease severity: a broader selection of mutations in tumors translates to an effectively elevated somatic mutation rate, leading to increased tumor burden.",0,0,0,1
"Correlation Between Germline and Somatic APC Mutations in FAP: Modifying the Two-Hit Hypothesis. APC is commonly presented as a quintessential tumor suppressor gene. In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) tumors, truncating germline and somatic mutations, or infrequently, allelic loss, are detected. Most sporadic colorectal cancers similarly display two APC mutations. However, insights from attenuated polyposis, mild disease linked to missense germline variants, and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1250-1450) suggest that APC mutations may not invariably cause a straightforward loss of protein function. We observed that FAP patients harboring germline APC mutations within a narrow segment (up to codons 1194-1392) primarily demonstrate allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas. This contrasts with other FAP patients, whose second hits are generally truncating mutations within the mutation cluster region. Our findings imply that distinct APC mutations confer varied selective advantages to cells, with mutations close to codon 1300 providing the most significant benefit. Allelic loss is markedly preferred in cells with a germline mutation near codon 1300. Furthermore, a differing germline-somatic APC mutation association is identified in FAP desmoids. Consequently, APC does not conform to the characteristics of a classical tumor suppressor. Our results additionally propose a novel mechanism for disease severity: a wider spectrum of mutations being selected in tumors leads to an effectively higher somatic mutation rate, resulting in the proliferation of more tumors.",0,0,0,1
"Site-Specific Germline APC Mutations Dictate Somatic Hit Type in FAP: A Reappraisal of Knudson's Two-Hit Hypothesis. The APC gene is frequently cited as a paradigmatic example of a tumor suppressor. In familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) tumors, truncating germline and somatic mutations, or occasionally allelic loss, are observed. A substantial proportion of sporadic colorectal cancers also possess two APC mutations. Yet, data from attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants associated with attenuated disease, and the somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1250-1450) indicate that APC mutations might not simply equate to a loss of protein function. Our study found that FAP patients with germline APC mutations located within a limited segment (at most codons 1194-1392) predominantly exhibit allelic loss in their colorectal adenomas, unlike other FAP patients, whose secondary hits tend to be truncating mutations in the mutation cluster region. These results suggest that various APC mutations provide cells with differential selective advantages, with mutations near codon 1300 conferring the greatest advantage. Allelic loss is intensely selected for in cells bearing a single mutation close to codon 1300. Additionally, a distinct germline-somatic APC mutation association exists in FAP desmoids. Therefore, APC cannot be considered a classical tumor suppressor. Our findings also illuminate a novel mechanism for disease severity: if a broader range of mutations is selected in tumors, the somatic mutation rate is effectively increased, leading to an elevated tumor count.",0,0,0,1
"Pooled Linkage Analysis of Hereditary Prostate Cancer to 1q24-25 from 772 ICPCG Families. Previous linkage investigations indicated a prostate cancer-susceptibility locus at 1q24-25. However, subsequent reports from additional family collections yielded conflicting outcomes. Furthermore, evidence for locus heterogeneity emerged through the identification of other putative hereditary prostate cancer loci on Xq27-28, 1q42-43, and 1p36. This investigation details a consolidated analysis of six markers within the 1q24-25 region, utilizing 772 families affected by hereditary prostate cancer. These families were ascertained by members of the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) from North America, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Globally, evidence for linkage was observed, with a peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity (HLOD) of 1.40 (P = 0.01) at D1S212. The estimated proportion of linked families (alpha) was 0.06 (1-LOD support interval 0.01-0.12). This evidence was not detectable via a nonparametric approach, likely attributable to extensive heterogeneity. Subsequent parametric analysis identified a substantial influence of male-to-male disease transmission within families. Among the subset of 491 such families, the peak HLOD reached 2.56 (P = 0.0006), and alpha was 0.11 (1-LOD support interval 0.04-0.19), contrasting with HLODs of 0 in the remaining 281 families. Within families demonstrating male-to-male transmission, alpha increased alongside an early mean age at diagnosis, supporting the linkage of a prostate cancer-susceptibility gene to 1q24-25, albeit within a specific subset of prostate cancer families. While HPC1 represents a minor fraction of all families affected by hereditary prostate cancer, it appears to assume a more prominent role in families characterized by several members affected at an early age and showing male-to-male disease transmission.",0,0,0,1

"BRCA1 R841W: A Potential Common Mutation Exhibiting a Moderate Phenotype. Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an elevated risk of breast and ovarian cancer, frequently manifesting at an early age.

Treatments administered have included plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. All patients have achieved some restoration of renal function. However, the exact contribution of pharmacological treatment versus spontaneous resolution to this improvement remains undetermined. It is probable that quinine-associated hemolytic-uremic syndrome occurs more frequently than currently acknowledged. Early recognition of this adverse reaction and prevention of further quinine exposure are essential, given its propensity for recurrence.",0,1,1,0
"Quinine-Associated Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome, observed after quinine ingestion, is a recently identified clinical entity, with only four cases previously reported in the literature across two descriptions. Our report adds a fifth case. The pathogenesis might involve antibodies that react specifically against platelets in the presence of quinine. Therapeutic interventions have comprised plasma exchange, prednisone, aspirin, and dipyridamole. Notably, all patients demonstrated some recovery of renal function. Yet, it is uncertain whether this improvement stemmed from medical treatment or spontaneous remission. It is likely that quinine-induced hemolytic-uremic syndrome is more common than currently recognized. Therefore, timely identification of this reaction and discontinuation of quinine exposure are critical, as the condition appears to be recurrent.",0,1,1,0

"Compensatory P-glycoprotein Upregulation in the Blood-Brain Barrier of MRP2-Deficient TR(-) Rats Mimics Seizure-Induced Induction in Wild-Type Animals. The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), a drug efflux transporter primarily in hepatocyte apical domains and potentially in brain capillary endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is absent in transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rats. These rats have been instrumental in identifying MRP2 substrates, such as phenytoin at the BBB. Recognizing the potential for compensatory transporter changes in genetically deficient models, this study examined P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, a key BBB drug efflux transporter, in TR(-) rat brains compared to wild-type Wistar rats. Immunohistochemistry, utilizing specific monoclonal antibodies for MRP2 and Pgp, revealed MRP2 labeling in normal Wistar rat brain microvessels, absent in TR(-) rats. Importantly, TR(-) rats demonstrated significant Pgp upregulation in brain capillary endothelial cells, a phenomenon not observed in liver sections. This Pgp overexpression in the BBB was comparable to that induced by pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Furthermore, experiments with the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and inhibitor tariquidar confirmed that Pgp in TR(-) rats is functional and compensates for the MRP2 deficiency in the BBB. These findings suggest Pgp's crucial role in compensating for MRP2 deficiency at the BBB, supporting MRP2's protective function by mitigating brain injury from cytotoxic compounds. Moreover, TR(-) rats represent a valuable model for investigating the effects of BBB Pgp overexpression on drug brain access, without requiring seizure induction.",0,1,1,0
"Blood-Brain Barrier P-glycoprotein Elevation in MRP2-Null TR(-) Rats Parallels Seizure-Evoked Increases in Control Animals. MRP2, a drug efflux transporter found predominantly in apical hepatocytes and conceivably in apical brain capillary endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant. This strain has been highly beneficial for identifying MRP2 substrates by comparing compound concentrations or activities in MRP2-deficient versus transport-competent Wistar rats. Our prior research identified phenytoin as an MRP2 substrate in the BBB using this methodology. However, the potential for compensatory upregulation of other transporters in genetically deficient models led us to investigate brain P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, a major BBB drug efflux transporter, in TR(-) rats versus non-mutant Wistar rats. We performed immunohistochemistry on brain and liver sections from TR(-) and normal Wistar rats, employing a novel MRP2 antibody and the C219 Pgp antibody. Immunofluorescence revealed extensive MRP2 labeling of brain microvessels in normal Wistar rats, which was absent in TR(-) rats. Crucially, TR(-) rats exhibited a significant increase in Pgp within brain capillary endothelial cells compared to wild-type controls, a change not apparent in liver. A similar extent of Pgp overexpression in the BBB also occurred following pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Systemic administration of phenobarbital (Pgp substrate) and tariquidar (Pgp inhibitor) in TR(-) rats confirmed Pgp's functionality and its compensatory role for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB. Consequently, these data highlight Pgp's significant contribution to compensating for MRP2 deficiency at the BBB. This compensatory mechanism likely serves to protect the brain from cytotoxic agents, thus reinforcing the concept of MRP2's protective function in the BBB. Furthermore, TR(-) rats offer a compelling model to explore the ramifications of BBB Pgp overexpression on cerebral drug access, obviating the need for seizure induction or other Pgp-stimulating events.",0,1,1,0
"Blood-Brain Barrier P-glycoprotein Overexpression in MRP2-Deficient TR(-) Rats: A Parallel to Seizure-Induced Upregulation in Wild-Type Counterparts. The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), an efflux transporter predominantly situated at the apical domain of hepatocytes and potentially at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells forming the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is missing in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant. This rat strain has proven invaluable for discerning MRP2 substrates by contrasting tissue concentrations or functional activities in MRP2-deficient animals with those in transport-competent Wistar rats. Our recent findings, utilizing this approach, established phenytoin as a BBB MRP2 substrate. However, a limitation of studies in genetically deficient models is the potential for compensatory alterations, such as the upregulation of other transporters. This prompted an investigation into brain P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, a primary drug efflux transporter at the BBB, in TR(-) rats compared to non-mutant Wistar rats. Methods involved immunohistochemical assessment of MRP2 and Pgp expression in brain and liver sections of TR(-) and normal Wistar rats, employing a novel, highly selective MRP2 antibody and the C219 Pgp antibody. Results showed robust immunofluorescence labeling of brain microvessels by the MRP2 antibody in normal Wistar rats, entirely absent in TR(-) rats. Notably, TR(-) rats exhibited significant Pgp upregulation within brain capillary endothelial cells relative to wild-type controls. No comparable Pgp upregulation was evident in liver sections. Intriguingly, similar Pgp overexpression in the BBB was observed following pilocarpine-induced seizures in wild-type Wistar rats. Experiments involving systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(-) rats corroborated Pgp's functional capacity and its compensatory role for the absence of MRP2 in the BBB. In conclusion, these data indicate that Pgp assumes a critical role in compensating for MRP2 deficiency within the BBB. Given that such a compensatory mechanism likely aims to mitigate cerebral injury from cytotoxic compounds, these findings support the notion of MRP2's protective function in the BBB. Furthermore, our results suggest that TR(-) rats offer an intriguing model for exploring the consequences of BBB Pgp overexpression on drug access to the brain, without the necessity of inducing seizures or other Pgp-enhancing stimuli.",0,1,1,0
"P-glycoprotein Compensatory Upregulation in MRP2-Null Rat Brain Mimics Seizure-Associated Induction. The multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), a drug efflux transporter primarily expressed in the apical domain of hepatocytes and putatively at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells constituting the blood-brain barrier (BBB), is absent in the transport-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rat mutant. This animal model has proven valuable for elucidating MRP2 substrates by contrasting tissue concentrations or functional activities in MRP2-deficient rats with those in transport-competent counterparts. Our previous work, employing this strategy, identified phenytoin as a BBB MRP2 substrate.

Consequently, we investigated brain P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression, a major drug efflux transporter in the BBB, in TR(-) rats relative to nonmutant Wistar rats. Immunohistochemistry was utilized to assess MRP2 and Pgp expression in brain and liver sections of both TR(-) and normal Wistar rats, employing a novel, highly selective MRP2 antibody and the C219 Pgp antibody. Immunofluorescence staining revealed abundant MRP2 labeling of cerebral microvessels in normal Wistar rats, a finding entirely absent in TR(-) rats. Critically, TR(-) rats exhibited a significant upregulation of Pgp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared to wild-type controls, with no comparable Pgp upregulation observed in liver sections.

Given that such compensation likely mitigates cerebral injury from cytotoxic compounds, these findings support the concept of MRP2's protective role in the BBB.

"An X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy Gene Exhibiting Unexpected Homology with ABC Transporters. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an X-linked disorder affecting 1 in 20,000 males, manifesting as either childhood cerebral ALD or adult adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The childhood form is more severe, with neurological symptoms appearing between 5-12 years and rapid central nervous system demyelination leading to death within a few years.

This study examined amiloride's influence on polydipsia and polyuria induced by chronic lithium chloride treatment in rats, alongside its effects on lithium concentrations in plasma, brain, kidney, thyroid, and red blood cells. Amiloride administration acutely (6 or 12 hours) and subacutely (3 days) reduced water consumption and urine output. At 6 hours post-amiloride, renal medullary lithium content decreased, while other organs showed no change. By 12 hours, a minor elevation in lithium levels was observed across all tissues. Following 3 days of co-treatment, a notable increase in plasma and tissue lithium was evident, despite a decrease in water intake. Across all experimental conditions, the amelioration of the lithium-induced diabetes insipidus-like syndrome by amiloride correlated with a reduction in the renal medulla-to-blood lithium ratio and an elevation in plasma potassium.

"Evaluation of Parasympathetic and Sympathetic Neurogenic Mechanisms in Rat Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cystitis. In cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats, impaired detrusor function and altered muscarinic receptor expression and effects are known. This study aimed to ascertain whether neuronal transmission is also affected by cystitis. Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and various agonists were examined in the presence and absence of muscarinic, adrenergic, and purinergic receptor antagonists. Generally, atropine diminished contractions, but notably, it also reduced responses to low-intensity electrical field stimulation (1-5 Hz) in inflamed preparations, a contrast to controls. In both types of preparations, purinoceptor desensitization with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) led to further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). Muscarinic receptor antagonists, including atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective'), and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective'), antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more effectively than the phasic component. 4-DAMP inhibited tonic contractions in controls more potently than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was diminished, and the antagonism by pirenzepine and 4-DAMP on the tonic component was substantially less efficient than in controls. Conversely, methoctramine augmented — rather than decreased — the tonic responses at high frequencies in inflamed tissues. While contractions to carbachol and ATP were equivalent in inflamed and control strips when normalized to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were smaller in inflamed strips. Consequently, in cystitis, substantial changes in efferent functional responses are evident. Postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations are reduced, and effects mediated by prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors may be enhanced.",0,1,1,0

Responses of urinary bladder strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide-exposed rats to electrical field stimulation and various agonists were measured with and without muscarinic, adrenergic, and purinergic receptor antagonists. Atropine consistently reduced contractions, but distinctively from controls, it also lessened responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity (1-5 Hz) in the inflamed samples. Desensitization of purinoceptors using alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) further decreased responses at frequencies below 10 Hz in both sets of preparations. Muscarinic receptor antagonists — atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective'), and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective') — demonstrated greater antagonism of the tonic component of electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile responses compared to the phasic component. Specifically, 4-DAMP showed stronger inhibition of tonic contractions in controls than methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was reduced, and the efficacy of pirenzepine and 4-DAMP antagonism on the tonic component was markedly lower than observed in controls. Moreover, in inflamed preparations, methoctramine led to an increase, rather than a decrease, in tonic responses at high frequencies. Contractions induced by carbachol and ATP were similar in inflamed and control strips when scaled against a potassium reference, but isoprenaline-induced relaxations were attenuated in inflamed strips. Therefore, cystitis precipitates significant alterations in efferent functional responses, including diminished postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations and potentially augmented effects from prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptors.",0,1,1,0
"An In Vitro Investigation of Neuroeffector Function in Cyclophosphamide-Induced Rat Cystitis. In rats afflicted with cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis, detrusor function is compromised, and the expression and actions of muscarinic receptors are altered. This research sought to determine if the neuronal transmission pathway is similarly affected by the presence of cystitis. Urinary strip preparations obtained from control animals and rats pretreated with cyclophosphamide underwent assessment of their responses to electrical field stimulation and specific agonists, in the absence and presence of muscarinic, adrenergic, and purinergic receptor blocking agents. Generally, atropine mitigated contractions, but uncharacteristically for controls, it also attenuated responses to low electrical field stimulation intensities (1-5 Hz) in the inflamed preparations. Desensitization of purinoceptors using alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) caused additional reductions at frequencies less than 10 Hz in both preparation types. Muscarinic receptor antagonists (atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective'), and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective')) antagonized the tonic element of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more potently than the phasic element. 4-DAMP exhibited greater potency in inhibiting tonic contractions in control tissues compared to methoctramine and pirenzepine. In inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was diminished, and the inhibitory effect of pirenzepine and 4-DAMP on the tonic component was considerably less effective than in control groups. In a contrasting finding to controls, methoctramine elevated — instead of reduced — the tonic responses at high frequencies. While carbachol and ATP-induced contractions were comparable in inflamed and control strips when expressed relative to a reference potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were reduced in inflamed strips. Thus, cystitis leads to significant modifications of efferent functional responses, characterized by reduced postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations and a potential increase in prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptor effects.",0,1,1,0
"In Vitro Analysis of Autonomic Neuromodulation in Rat Bladder with Cyclophosphamide-Induced Cystitis. Cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis in rats is associated with impaired detrusor function and alterations in muscarinic receptor expression and their effects. The current study investigated whether neuronal transmission itself might be influenced by cystitis. Responses of urinary strip preparations from both control and cyclophosphamide-pretreated rats were analyzed following electrical field stimulation and exposure to agonists, both with and without the presence of muscarinic, adrenergic, and purinergic receptor antagonists. Atropine generally decreased contractions, but notably, in inflamed preparations, it also attenuated responses to low-intensity electrical field stimulation (1-5 Hz), differing from observations in controls. In both control and inflamed tissues, purinoceptor desensitization achieved with alpha,beta-methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) resulted in further reductions at low frequencies (<10 Hz). The muscarinic receptor antagonists, specifically atropine, 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP) ('M(1)/M(3)/M(5)-selective'), methoctramine ('M(2)-selective'), and pirenzepine ('M(1)-selective'), antagonized the tonic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contractile response more profoundly than the phasic component. 4-DAMP demonstrated superior potency in inhibiting tonic contractions in control strips when compared to methoctramine and pirenzepine. However, in inflamed preparations, the muscarinic receptor antagonism on the phasic component of the electrical field stimulation-evoked contraction was diminished, and the antagonism by pirenzepine and 4-DAMP on the tonic component was considerably less effective than in controls. Furthermore, methoctramine, contrary to its action in controls, increased tonic responses at high frequencies in inflamed tissues. While contractions induced by carbachol and ATP were found to be similar in inflamed and control strips when referenced to a potassium response, isoprenaline-induced relaxations were reduced in inflamed strips. In conclusion, cystitis is characterized by substantial changes in efferent functional responses, including reduced postjunctional beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations and a potential augmentation of prejunctional inhibitory muscarinic receptor effects.",0,1,1,0

"Peripheral Mechanism of L-Dopa in Reversing Ammonia Coma in Rats. Ammonia-induced coma was induced in rats through an intraperitoneal administration of 1.7 mmol NH4CL, manifesting within 10 to 15 minutes. This comatose state was prevented by prior gastric intubation of 1.68 mmol L-dopa, administered 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injection. The prophylactic effect of L-dopa was associated with simultaneous reductions in both blood and brain ammonia levels, an elevation in brain dopamine concentrations, and an increased renal excretion of ammonia and urea. Crucially, intraventricular dopamine infusion, even when sufficient to achieve comparable brain dopamine increases, failed to prevent the ammonia coma and did not alter blood or brain ammonia levels. Furthermore, bilateral nephrectomy negated the beneficial impact of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia, thereby failing to prevent the ammonia coma. These findings demonstrate that the observed decrease in blood and brain ammonia, and the prevention of ammonia coma following L-dopa administration, are attributable to dopamine's peripheral influence on renal function, rather than its central nervous system activity. Such results offer a plausible explanation for the therapeutic benefits noted in some encephalopathic patients treated with L-dopa.",0,1,1,0
"L-Dopa's Peripheral Renal Action in Preventing Ammonia Coma in a Rodent Model. The induction of ammonia coma in rats occurred 10 to 15 minutes post-intraperitoneal injection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL. This coma was successfully averted by administering 1.68 mmol L-dopa via gastric intubation 15 minutes prior to the ammonium salt. The efficacy of L-dopa correlated with a reduction in both blood and brain ammonia, an increase in brain dopamine, and enhanced renal excretion of ammonia and urea. To discern the mechanism, an intraventricular infusion of dopamine, which increased brain dopamine to a similar degree, did not prevent the ammonia coma or influence blood and brain ammonia concentrations. Moreover, bilateral nephrectomy abolished the advantageous effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia, consequently failing to prevent ammonia coma. These observations establish that the decrease in blood and brain ammonia, along with the prevention of ammonia coma by L-dopa, is explainable by the peripheral impact of dopamine on kidney function, rather than its central effects. This provides a compelling rationale for the observed positive outcomes in certain encephalopathic patients receiving L-dopa therapy.",0,1,1,0
"Demonstration of a Peripheral Mechanism for L-Dopa's Attenuation of Ammonia Coma in Rats. Ammonia coma was generated in rats within 10 to 15 minutes following an intraperitoneal injection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL. Pre-treatment with 1.68 mmol L-dopa, delivered by gastric intubation 15 minutes prior to the ammonium salt, prevented the onset of this coma. The protective action of L-dopa was linked to a concomitant decrease in blood and brain ammonia, an elevation in brain dopamine, and an augmented renal excretion of both ammonia and urea. To clarify the locus of action, intraventricular infusion of dopamine, despite raising brain dopamine levels to an equivalent extent, failed to prevent ammonia coma and did not influence blood or brain ammonia concentrations. Furthermore, bilateral nephrectomy eliminated L-dopa's beneficial influence on blood and brain ammonia, thereby failing to prevent the ammonia coma. These findings conclusively indicate that the reduction in blood and brain ammonia, and the prevention of ammonia coma following L-dopa administration, are attributable to the peripheral effects of dopamine on kidney function rather than its central activity.

"Renal-Dependent Prevention of Ammonia Coma by L-Dopa in a Rat Model. In rats, an intraperitoneal injection of 1.7 mmol NH4CL consistently induced ammonia coma within 10 to 15 minutes.

The observed efficacy of L-dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia concentrations, an increase in brain dopamine, and an elevated renal excretion of ammonia and urea. Further investigation revealed that intraventricular infusion of dopamine, sufficient to match the increase in brain dopamine, did not prevent ammonia coma nor did it affect blood and brain ammonia levels. Significantly, bilateral nephrectomy abolished the protective effect of L-dopa on blood and brain ammonia, and consequently, the ammonia coma was not prevented. Therefore, the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma subsequent to L-dopa administration are explained by the peripheral action of dopamine on renal function, rather than through its central effects.

"A Kinetic Variant of Phenylketonuria Arising from a 3-Base Pair In-Frame Deletion in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene. Phenylketonuria (PKU), an autosomal recessive disorder, stems from a deficiency in the hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). While a complete absence of PAH activity leads to classic PKU, residual enzyme function can result in variant disease forms. This report details a mild PKU variant linked to a 3-base pair in-frame deletion (delta 194) within the PAH gene, which causes a significantly reduced enzyme affinity for phenylalanine (Km = 160 nM). Functional assays confirm that this specific deletion is responsible for the observed mutant phenotype. Given the deletion's localization to the third exon, a region lacking homology with other hydroxylases, it is proposed that exon 3 plays a critical role in determining the enzyme's substrate specificity for phenylalanine. Furthermore, the absence of this deletion in 98 tested PKU patients suggests that this genetic event is likely a recent occurrence, originating on a haplotype 2 gene background within Portugal.",0,1,1,0
"Characterization of a Phenylketonuria Kinetic Variant Caused by a 3-Base Pair In-Frame Deletion in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive condition resulting from insufficient hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) enzyme activity. The phenotypic spectrum ranges from typical PKU, associated with absent PAH activity, to variant forms exhibiting some residual enzyme function. Our study describes a 3-base pair in-frame deletion (delta 194) in the PAH gene that underlies a mild variant of PKU. This genetic alteration results in a markedly diminished affinity of the enzyme for phenylalanine, quantified by a Km of 160 nM. We present functional evidence establishing the deletion's direct causality for the mutant enzymatic phenotype. The deletion's presence in exon 3, an area without homology to other hydroxylase enzymes, leads us to hypothesize that this exon is integral to the enzyme's specific interaction with phenylalanine. Population screening of 98 PKU patients did not identify this particular deletion, indicating its probable recent emergence on a haplotype 2 gene background in Portugal.",0,1,1,0
"Genetic Basis of a Phenylketonuria Kinetic Variant: A 3-Base Pair In-Frame Deletion in the Phenylalanine Hydroxylase Gene. The autosomal recessive disorder Phenylketonuria (PKU) is fundamentally caused by a deficiency of the liver enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). While total absence of PAH activity is characteristic of classical PKU, variant forms of the disease arise when residual enzymatic function persists. Here, we document a mild PKU variant stemming from a 3-base pair in-frame deletion (delta 194) within the PAH gene. This deletion is associated with a pronounced reduction in the enzyme's affinity for phenylalanine, with a Km value of 160 nM. We provide rigorous functional validation demonstrating that this specific deletion is responsible for the observed mutant enzymatic characteristics. The deletion's location within the third exon, which exhibits no sequence homology with other hydroxylases, suggests exon 3's involvement in the enzyme's substrate specificity for phenylalanine. An analysis of 98 PKU patients revealed no other instances of this specific deletion, implying a recent molecular origin on a haplotype 2 gene background in Portugal.",0,1,1,0

"Investigating Angiogenesis as a Therapeutic Target for Ribavirin-Induced Hemolytic Anemia. BACKGROUND/AIMS: Ribavirin has recently been identified as an angiogenesis inhibitor, and several known angiogenesis inhibitors, such as sunitinib and sorafenib, are associated with acute hemolysis. Our objective was to explore a potential association among hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and soluble angiogenesis markers, which could represent modifiable factors for developing anti-anemia strategies.

"Optimal Ribavirin Dose Reduction Timing for Hemolysis in Chronic Hepatitis C Combination Therapy. BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia represents a significant adverse effect of interferon and ribavirin combination therapy. Ribavirin-induced hemolysis often necessitates dose reduction. This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the most appropriate timing for ribavirin reduction in patients experiencing hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: Of 160 patients receiving 24-week combination therapy for HCV-genotype 1b with high viral load, 37 developed anemia (hemoglobin <10 g/dl or associated symptoms). These 37 patients subsequently had their ribavirin dose reduced by one 200 mg tablet daily. Following this reduction, 27 patients (Group A) completed the full 24-week course, while 10 patients (Group B) discontinued due to hemoglobin levels falling below 8.5 g/dl or severe anemia-related adverse events. We evaluated the ultimate efficacy and safety in both groups post-reduction. RESULTS: The sustained virological response (SVR) rate was 29.6% (8/27) in Group A and 10% (1/10) in Group B. The combined SVR and biological response rate of 34.4% (12/27) in Group A was marginally higher than 10% (1/10) in Group B (P = 0.051). Furthermore, the rate of therapy continuation was significantly higher in patients with a hemoglobin level of ≥10 g/dl at the time of ribavirin reduction compared to those with <10 g/dl (P = 0.036).

Post-reduction, 27 patients (Group A) completed the 24-week treatment, whereas 10 patients (Group B) could not continue therapy due to hemoglobin drops below 8.5 g/dl or severe anemia-related effects. Efficacy and safety were assessed in both groups after the ribavirin reduction. RESULTS: Sustained virological response (SVR) was achieved by 29.6% (8/27) in Group A and 10% (1/10) in Group B. The cumulative SVR plus biological response in Group A (34.4%, 12/27) was slightly superior to Group B (10%, 1/10) (P = 0.051). Therapy continuation rates were higher for patients whose hemoglobin was ≥10 g/dl at the time of reduction, compared to those with <10 g/dl (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: A ribavirin dose reduction when hemoglobin levels are at or above 10 g/dl is advisable for maintaining both efficacy and managing side effects.",0,1,1,0
"Determining the Appropriate Time for Ribavirin Dosage Reduction in Hepatitis C Patients Experiencing Hemolysis During Interferon-Based Therapy. BACKGROUND: Hemolytic anemia stands as a principal adverse event associated with combination therapy involving interferon and ribavirin. This ribavirin-induced hemolysis frequently necessitates a reduction in drug dosage. This clinical retrospective cohort study investigated the optimal moment to decrease ribavirin in patients who developed hemolysis during their combination treatment. METHODS: Out of 160 patients undergoing a 24-week regimen of combination therapy for HCV-genotype 1b with a high viral load, 37 experienced anemia, characterized by hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dl or other anemia-related manifestations. Following this, these 37 patients had their ribavirin dose lowered by one 200 mg tablet daily. Subsequent to the ribavirin reduction, 27 of these 37 patients (designated Group A) were able to persist with the combination therapy for the entire 24 weeks. Conversely, 10 patients (designated Group B) were unable to continue treatment because their hemoglobin levels fell to or below 8.5 g/dl or they suffered severe anemia-related side effects. The study evaluated the ultimate efficacy and safety profiles after ribavirin reduction in both Group A and Group B. RESULTS: A sustained virological response (SVR) was observed in 29.6% (8/27) of Group A and 10% (1/10) of Group B. The combined rate of SVR and biological response in Group A, at 34.4% (12/27), showed a marginal superiority over Group B's 10% (1/10) (P = 0.051). Regarding hemoglobin levels at the time of ribavirin reduction, the proportion of patients continuing therapy was greater for those with ≥10 g/dl hemoglobin compared to those with <10 g/dl (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Decreasing the ribavirin dose at a hemoglobin level of ≥10 g/dl appears appropriate, considering both treatment efficacy and adverse event management.",0,1,1,0
"Ribavirin Dose Modification Timing in Chronic Hepatitis C Patients with Hemolysis During Combination Treatment. BACKGROUND: The combination of interferon and ribavirin frequently induces hemolytic anemia, a significant adverse event that often mandates a reduction in ribavirin dosage. This retrospective clinical cohort study investigated the most opportune time for ribavirin dose reduction in patients developing hemolysis during combination therapy. METHODS: From a cohort of 160 patients receiving 24-week combination therapy for HCV-genotype 1b and high viral load, 37 developed anemia, defined by a hemoglobin level below 10 g/dl or presenting with anemia-related symptoms. For these 37 patients, the daily ribavirin dose was reduced by one 200 mg tablet. Post-reduction, 27 patients (Group A) successfully completed the full 24-week combination therapy course. However, 10 patients (Group B) discontinued therapy due to hemoglobin levels decreasing to <8.5 g/dl or the occurrence of severe anemia-related side effects. The study assessed the final efficacy and safety outcomes in both Group A and Group B after the ribavirin reduction. RESULTS: Sustained virological response (SVR) rates were 29.6% (8/27) in Group A and 10% (1/10) in Group B. Group A exhibited a slightly higher rate of SVR plus biological response, at 34.4% (12/27), compared to Group B's 10% (1/10) (P = 0.051). Patients with a hemoglobin level of ≥10 g/dl at the point of ribavirin reduction demonstrated a higher rate of therapy continuation than those with <10 g/dl (P = 0.036). CONCLUSIONS: A ribavirin dose reduction when hemoglobin levels are at or above 10 g/dl is deemed appropriate concerning both treatment effectiveness and the management of adverse effects.",0,1,1,0
"Investigation of Chronic Carbamazepine Administration in Rats: Efficacy, Toxicity, and Impact on Plasma and Tissue Folate Levels. Folate deficiency is a frequently observed issue during long-term antiepileptic drug (AED) regimens. Carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely utilized AED, has been linked to this problem in some clinical investigations. A rat model was established to study the consequences of prolonged CBZ therapy on folate concentrations within the animal. During the model's development, it was discovered that propylene glycol, a common vehicle, when administered in high doses independently, demonstrated anticonvulsant properties against induced seizures and suppressed weight gain. Furthermore, seizures provoked by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) proved to be a more sensitive indicator of CBZ's protective effect compared to seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ as an aqueous suspension at 250 mg/kg every 8 hours offered sustained protection against HFDE-induced seizures and exhibited minimal toxicity, as evidenced by weight gain over an 8-week treatment period. However, the CBZ concentrations measured in the plasma and brain of these animals were lower than what is typically considered protective. This CBZ treatment did not exert any apparent detrimental effect on the rat's folate concentrations; in fact, liver folate levels rose after 6 weeks of treatment, and plasma folate levels increased at 8 weeks.",0,1,1,0
"Evaluation of Chronic Carbamazepine Treatment in Rats: Efficacy, Adverse Effects, and Folate Concentration Changes in Plasma and Tissues. Chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy often presents with folate depletion, a concern that has been associated with carbamazepine (CBZ) in several clinical studies. To investigate the influence of chronic CBZ administration on folate levels in rats, an animal model was developed. An unexpected finding during the model's creation was that the vehicle, propylene glycol, at elevated doses, offered protection against induced seizures and hindered weight gain. It was also determined that hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE)-induced seizures provided a more sensitive measure of CBZ's protective capacity than maximal electroshock (MES)-induced seizures. Administering CBZ orally as an aqueous suspension at 250 mg/kg every 8 hours consistently protected against HFDE-induced seizures and showed negligible toxicity, assessed by weight gain over an 8-week duration. Despite this observed protection, CBZ levels in the plasma and brain of treated animals were below concentrations generally deemed therapeutic. Importantly, this specific CBZ regimen did not negatively impact rat folate concentrations; instead, folate levels increased in the liver after 6 weeks and in the plasma by 8 weeks of treatment.",0,1,1,0
"The Impact of Long-Term Carbamazepine Therapy in Rats: Anticonvulsant Activity, Toxicity Profile, and Folate Status. Folate deficiency is a recurring challenge in prolonged antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, with carbamazepine (CBZ), a widely prescribed AED, implicated in certain clinical reports. A rat model was established to assess the effects of long-term CBZ administration on folate concentrations. During the model's development, it was noted that high doses of propylene glycol, a standard vehicle, independently offered protection against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain. Furthermore, hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE)-induced seizures proved more responsive to CBZ's protective actions than those induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Administered orally as an aqueous suspension every 8 hours at 250 mg/kg, CBZ continuously guarded against HFDE-induced seizures and exhibited minimal toxicity, based on weight gain over an 8-week treatment period. Curiously, plasma and brain CBZ levels in these animals were found to be below typically protective thresholds. This CBZ treatment had no discernible detrimental effect on rat folate levels; conversely, liver folate concentrations increased after 6 weeks, and plasma folate concentrations rose at 8 weeks of treatment.",0,1,1,0
"Investigating Chronic Carbamazepine Treatment in Rats: Efficacy, Safety, and Influence on Folate Concentrations. Folate depletion frequently arises as a concern during chronic antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, a phenomenon occasionally linked to carbamazepine (CBZ), a commonly employed AED, in clinical studies. To investigate the consequences of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in a rat model, an experimental design was developed. Interestingly, during the model's development, the vehicle propylene glycol, when administered alone at high doses, was observed to provide protection against induced seizures and to impede weight gain. The study also determined that seizures provoked by hexafluorodiethyl ether (HFDE) offered a more sensitive measure of CBZ's protective capabilities compared to seizures induced by maximal electroshock (MES). Oral administration of CBZ at a dose of 250 mg/kg via an aqueous suspension every 8 hours consistently provided protection against HFDE-induced seizures and demonstrated minimal toxicity, assessed by weight gain throughout an 8-week treatment course. Despite this, the measured CBZ levels in the plasma and brain of these animals were below those typically considered protective. Notably, this specific CBZ regimen did not adversely affect folate concentrations in the rats; rather, folate levels increased in the liver after 6 weeks and in the plasma after 8 weeks of treatment.",0,1,1,0

"An instance of severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure attributed to co-administration of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir. This report details a case involving a significant drug interaction between simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir, culminating in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. A 72-year-old white male with a history of human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia presented with a 3-day history of widespread pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine. The patient's medication regimen included 80 mg simvastatin at bedtime (started 27 days prior), amiodarone initially at 400 mg daily for 7 days then 200 mg daily (started 19 days prior), and 400 mg atazanavir daily (initiated at least 2 years prior). Laboratory tests revealed a creatine kinase level of 66,680 U/L, blood urea nitrogen of 93 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 1579 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase of 738 U/L. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's antiretroviral therapy were temporarily stopped; forced alkaline diuresis was administered, and dialysis commenced. Nine days thereafter, creatine kinase had decreased to 1695 U/L and creatinine to 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was discharged and continued outpatient dialysis for one month until full recovery of his renal function. The risk of rhabdomyolysis is elevated when simvastatin metabolism is inhibited by concurrently administered drugs. Simvastatin undergoes metabolism via CYP3A4, and both amiodarone and atazanavir are known CYP3A4 inhibitors. Considering pharmacokinetic differences among statins is essential for assessing potential drug interaction risks. For patients requiring concurrent statin and CYP3A4 inhibitor therapy, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin present the lowest interaction risk, atorvastatin carries a moderate risk, while simvastatin and lovastatin pose the highest risk and should be avoided.",1,1,0,0
"Severe rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury arising from the concurrent administration of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir. The objective of this paper is to document a severe interaction among simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir, leading to rhabdomyolysis and acute kidney injury. A 72-year-old Caucasian male, with pre-existing human immunodeficiency virus infection, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia, presented with three days of generalized discomfort, tiredness, and discolored (dark orange) urine. His medication history included 80 mg simvastatin nightly (initiated 27 days previously), amiodarone 400 mg daily for one week then 200 mg daily (started 19 days previously), and 400 mg atazanavir daily (begun over two years prior). Significant laboratory findings included a creatine kinase level of 66,680 U/L, blood urea nitrogen of 93 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 1579 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase of 738 U/L. Simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's HIV medications were all temporarily withdrawn; he received forced alkaline diuresis and initiated dialysis. After nine days, his creatine kinase levels had fallen to 1695 U/L, and creatinine was 3.3 mg/dL. The patient was subsequently discharged, continuing outpatient dialysis for a month until his renal function was restored. The potential for rhabdomyolysis is heightened when drugs that inhibit simvastatin's metabolism are co-administered. Simvastatin is metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, and both amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized as CYP3A4 inhibitors. An important consideration for evaluating the risk of drug interactions involves the pharmacokinetic variations among statins. When patients require the simultaneous use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin are associated with the lowest risk of interaction; atorvastatin carries a moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin present the highest risk and should therefore be avoided.",1,1,0,0
"An incident of severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure linked to the simultaneous use of simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir. This article aims to present a case of profound interaction among simvastatin, amiodarone, and atazanavir, culminating in rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. A 72-year-old white male, suffering from human immunodeficiency virus, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and hyperlipidemia, presented with generalized pain, fatigue, and dark orange urine, symptoms persisting for three days. His prescribed medications included 80 mg simvastatin nightly (initiated 27 days earlier); amiodarone 400 mg daily for 7 days, then 200 mg daily (started 19 days earlier); and 400 mg atazanavir daily (commenced at least 2 years previously). Initial laboratory assessment revealed a creatine kinase level of 66,680 U/L, blood urea nitrogen of 93 mg/dL, creatinine of 4.6 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase of 1579 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase of 738 U/L. Subsequent actions involved the temporary cessation of simvastatin, amiodarone, and the patient's human immunodeficiency virus medications, followed by forced alkaline diuresis and the initiation of dialysis. Nine days later, the patient's creatine kinase levels had declined to 1695 U/L, and creatinine was recorded at 3.3 mg/dL. Following discharge, the patient continued outpatient dialysis for one month until his renal function fully recovered. The likelihood of rhabdomyolysis escalation occurs in the presence of co-administered drugs that impede simvastatin metabolism. Simvastatin is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4. Both amiodarone and atazanavir are recognized as potent inhibitors of CYP3A4. Therefore, pharmacokinetic disparities among statins represent a critical factor in evaluating the potential for drug interactions. For patients needing concomitant use of statins and CYP3A4 inhibitors, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin demonstrate the lowest interaction risk; atorvastatin carries a moderate risk, whereas simvastatin and lovastatin are associated with the highest risk and thus warrant avoidance.",1,1,0,0

"Prevalence of Spironolactone-Associated Renal Insufficiency and Hyperkalemia in Contemporary Heart Failure Management. A previous randomized controlled trial on spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk for hyperkalemia (2%) and renal insufficiency (0%). Given that heart failure treatments have evolved since these benefits were initially documented, the current prevalence of these complications may differ. We therefore aimed to ascertain the prevalence and clinical correlates of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients receiving spironolactone. A case-control study was conducted, involving heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical setting. Cases were defined as patients who developed hyperkalemia (K(+) >5.0 mEq/L) or renal insufficiency (Cr >=2.5 mg/dL) and were compared against two randomly selected controls per case. Baseline and follow-up clinical characteristics, medications, and serum chemistries were analyzed. Sixty-seven of 926 patients (7.2%) required spironolactone discontinuation due to hyperkalemia (n = 33) or renal failure (n = 34). Patients experiencing hyperkalemia were older, more frequently diabetic, had elevated baseline serum potassium, lower baseline potassium supplement doses, and were more often treated with beta-blockers compared to controls (n = 134). Those developing renal insufficiency exhibited lower baseline body weight, higher baseline serum creatinine, required increased doses of loop diuretics, and were more commonly prescribed thiazide diuretics than controls.

"Influence of Converting Enzyme Inhibition on Adriamycin Nephropathy Progression. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of enalapril, a converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), in Munich-Wistar rats afflicted with pre-existing adriamycin nephrosis. Following a solitary adriamycin administration, animals were stratified after one month into four cohorts, ensuring matching for albuminuria levels, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentrations. Groups 1 and 3 served as control groups without treatment, whereas groups 2 and 4 were administered enalapril. Early investigations, involving micropuncture studies in groups 1 and 2 after 10 days, revealed that enalapril decreased arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg for group 2 vs. 1, P < 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < 0.05). Crucially, this occurred without a concomitant reduction in albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). The sustained impact of enalapril on the advancement of renal damage in adriamycin nephrosis was evaluated in groups 3 and 4 at the four- and six-month marks. Long-term enalapril administration in group 4 successfully lowered blood pressure, yet it did not diminish albuminuria. Control rats in group 3 demonstrated a continuous decline in GFR (0.35 +/- 0.08 ml/min at 4 months; 0.27 +/- 0.07 ml/min at 6 months). While enalapril therapy in group 4 attenuated the reduction in GFR, it failed to entirely prevent it (0.86 +/- 0.15 ml/min at 4 months; 0.69 +/- 0.13 ml/min at 6 months, both P < 0.05 compared to group 3).

Enalapril was administered to groups 2 and 4, whereas groups 1 and 3 served as control subjects. Ten-day micropuncture assessments on groups 1 and 2 demonstrated that enalapril lowered arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P < 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < 0.05). However, it did not alter albuminuria (617 +/- 50 vs. 570 +/- 47 mg/day) or GFR (1.03 +/- 0.04 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.11 ml/min). To evaluate enalapril's efficacy on the progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis, groups 3 and 4 were re-examined at four and six months.

In Munich-Wistar rats presenting with established adriamycin nephrosis, the impact of the converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI) enalapril was evaluated. One month after receiving a single adriamycin dose, rats were segregated into four groups, ensuring comparability in albuminuria, blood pressure, and plasma albumin concentration. While groups 1 and 3 served as controls, groups 2 and 4 received enalapril treatment. After 10 days, micropuncture examinations in groups 1 and 2 revealed that enalapril significantly lowered arterial blood pressure (101 +/- 2 vs. 124 +/- 3 mm Hg, group 2 vs. 1, P < 0.05) and glomerular capillary pressure (54 +/- 1 vs. 61 +/- 2 mm Hg, P < 0.05).

The long-term influence of enalapril on the progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephrosis was investigated in groups 3 and 4 at the four- and six-month time points. In group 4, chronic enalapril therapy successfully decreased blood pressure but had no impact on albuminuria reduction.

"Sustained Pressor Effect for 18 Hours Following a 6-Hour Adrenaline Infusion: Evidence for the Adrenaline-Hypertension Hypothesis. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover investigation, ten healthy participants received 6-hour intravenous administrations of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), or a 5% dextrose solution (5.4 ml/h), separated by two-week intervals. Hemodynamic responses were monitored via intra-arterial ambulatory systems for 18 hours after cessation of the infusions. Adrenaline, unlike noradrenaline, induced a delayed and prolonged increase in blood pressure. Throughout the entire post-infusion observation period, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were found to be 6% (SEM 2%) and 7% (SEM 2%) greater, respectively, following adrenaline administration compared to dextrose (ANOVA, p < 0.001). These results indicate that a 6-hour exposure to ""stress"" physiological levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) can elicit a sustained pressor response, providing substantial support for the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis in humans.",1,1,0,0
"Elucidating the Adrenaline-Hypertension Hypothesis: An 18-Hour Post-Infusion Pressor Response After 6 Hours of Adrenaline Exposure. This double-blind, crossover trial involved ten healthy volunteers, who underwent 6-hour infusions of adrenaline (15 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.458 pmol), noradrenaline (30 ng/kg/min; 1 ng = 5.911 pmol), and a 5% dextrose control solution (5.4 ml/h). These interventions were administered in random sequence, with a two-week washout period between each. Following the discontinuation of infusions, hemodynamic effects were tracked for 18 hours using intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring. A delayed and extended pressor effect was observed specifically after adrenaline, but not following noradrenaline. Across the total 18-hour post-infusion period, mean systolic arterial pressure was 6% (SEM 2%) and mean diastolic arterial pressure was 7% (SEM 2%) higher after adrenaline compared with dextrose administration (ANOVA, p < 0.001). Consequently, ""stress""-comparable adrenaline levels (230 pg/ml) maintained for six hours generate a delayed and persistent pressor response.

Intra-arterial ambulatory monitoring was employed to track hemodynamic effects for 18 hours subsequent to the cessation of these infusions. A delayed and prolonged pressor effect was exclusively observed after adrenaline administration, distinct from noradrenaline. Over the entire post-infusion duration, systolic and diastolic arterial pressures were elevated by 6% (SEM 2%) and 7% (SEM 2%), respectively, compared to the dextrose control (ANOVA, p < 0.001).

"Demonstration of an 18-Hour Pressor Effect After 6 Hours of Adrenaline Infusion, Supporting the Adrenaline-Hypertension Hypothesis. To investigate the adrenaline-hypertension hypothesis, a double-blind, crossover study was conducted involving ten healthy volunteers.

Hemodynamic effects were subsequently monitored for 18 hours after infusion termination using intra-arterial ambulatory techniques. The results showed that adrenaline, but not noradrenaline, elicited a delayed and sustained pressor response. Across the full 18-hour post-infusion period, systolic arterial pressure was 6% (SEM 2%) higher and diastolic arterial pressure was 7% (SEM 2%) higher following adrenaline exposure compared to the dextrose condition (ANOVA, p < 0.001). This indicates that physiological ""stress"" levels of adrenaline (230 pg/ml) maintained for six hours induce a delayed and protracted elevation in blood pressure.

"Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Type II Incidence and Post-Transplant Platelet Count Trajectories in Liver Transplant Recipients. BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is prevalent in end-stage liver disease patients, typically stemming from portal hypertension, diminished thrombopoietin levels, and endotoxemia. The influence of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) on post-liver transplantation thrombocytopenia remains poorly characterized, with limited and conflicting literature. Our study aimed to delineate the perioperative progression of thrombocytopenia following liver transplantation and ascertain the prevalence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the medical records of 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 for end-stage or malignant hepatic conditions. We examined preoperative platelet counts, the postoperative platelet course, and clinical indicators of HIT type II. RESULTS: Pre-transplantation thrombocytopenia was observed in 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients, significantly associated with Model of End-Stage Liver Disease scores and liver cirrhosis. The platelet count surpassed 100,000/uL in most patients (n = 193) by a median of 7 days. Clinical HIT type II was identified in four (1.95%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of HIT in patients with end-stage hepatic failure is infrequent, estimated at approximately 1.95%. To further mitigate HIT type II risk, intravenous heparin should be avoided, and prophylactic anticoagulation should involve low-molecular-weight heparin once platelet counts have normalized.",1,1,0,0
"Postoperative Platelet Count Dynamics and Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Type II in Liver Graft Recipients. BACKGROUND: End-stage liver disease frequently presents with thrombocytopenia, primarily attributed to portal hypertension, reduced thrombopoietin, and endotoxemia. The role of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) in post-liver transplantation thrombocytopenia is not fully elucidated, with existing reports offering inconsistent findings. This study sought to characterize the perioperative course of thrombocytopenia following liver transplantation and to determine the frequency of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data of 205 adult patients consecutively undergoing full-size liver transplantation between January 2006 and December 2010 due to end-stage or malignant liver pathology. Variables analyzed included preoperative platelet count, the trend of postoperative platelets, and clinical manifestations of HIT type II. RESULTS: A substantial proportion, 155 (75.6%) of 205 patients, exhibited thrombocytopenia prior to transplantation, which was markedly influenced by their Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and the presence of liver cirrhosis. The platelet count recovered to exceed 100,000/uL in the majority of patients (n = 193) within a median of 7 days. Regarding HIT II, four patients (1.95%) demonstrated this condition. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIT in individuals with end-stage hepatic failure is low, at approximately 1.95%.

"Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Type II Frequency and Platelet Count Normalization Following Liver Transplantation. BACKGROUND: Thrombocytopenia is a common complication in patients with end-stage liver disease, predominantly caused by portal hypertension, decreased thrombopoietin levels, and endotoxemia. The significance of immune-mediated heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT type II) as a cause of post-liver transplantation thrombocytopenia is not well-established, with available literature presenting contradictory data. The objective of our research was to illustrate the perioperative trajectory of thrombocytopenia after liver transplantation and to assess the prevalence of clinical HIT type II. METHOD: We conducted a retrospective examination of medical records from 205 consecutive adult patients who underwent full-size liver transplantation for end-stage or malignant liver disease from January 2006 to December 2010. Our analysis included preoperative platelet counts, the evolution of postoperative platelet levels, and clinical indications of HIT type II. RESULTS: Prior to transplantation, 155 (75.6%) out of 205 patients presented with thrombocytopenia, a condition notably affected by their Model of End-Stage Liver Disease score and the presence of liver cirrhosis. Most patients (n = 193) achieved a platelet count exceeding 100,000/uL at a median of 7 days. Four patients (1.95%) were diagnosed with clinical HIT type II. CONCLUSIONS: With an approximate rate of 1.95%, the incidence of HIT in patients experiencing end-stage hepatic failure is rare.

"Evaluation of Labetalol-Induced Hypotension with Inhalation Anesthetics for Middle-Ear Surgery. The present investigation examined the utility of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic antagonist, as a hypotensive agent when combined with halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane for middle-ear surgical procedures. This study enrolled 23 adult patients. Mean arterial pressure was lowered from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmHg to 52 +/- 1 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 98 +/- 10 minutes in the halothane (H) group, from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmHg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 129 +/- 11 minutes in the enflurane (E) group, and from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmHg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 135 +/- 15 minutes in the isoflurane (I) group. The average inspiratory concentrations of H, E, and I during the hypotensive period were 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%, respectively. Patients also received fentanyl and d-tubocurarine. The initial labetalol dosage for blood pressure reduction ranged from 0.52 to 0.59 mg/kg across all groups. Heart rate remained stable during hypotension, showing no evidence of tachy- or bradycardia. Operating conditions, assessed double-blind for bleeding, exhibited no significant inter-group differences. Serum creatinine concentrations significantly increased from pre-hypotension levels in all groups during hypotension, returning to baseline postoperatively in the H and E groups, but not in the I group. No rebound phenomenon in blood pressure or heart rate was observed following hypotension.

"Labetalol for Controlled Hypotension with Halothane, Enflurane, or Isoflurane in Middle-Ear Surgery. This investigation assessed the efficacy of labetalol, an alpha- and beta-adrenergic blocking agent, in inducing controlled hypotension when co-administered with inhalation anesthetics (halothane, enflurane, or isoflurane) for middle-ear surgery. The study included 23 adult patients. Across the halothane (H), enflurane (E), and isoflurane (I) groups, mean arterial pressure was successfully lowered to target levels for extended durations. Specifically, the H group's mean arterial pressure decreased from 86 +/- 5 (s.e. mean) mmHg to 52 +/- 1 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.7 to 6.9 +/- 0.1 kPa) over 98 +/- 10 minutes. In the E group, pressure fell from 79 +/- 5 to 53 +/- 1 mmHg (10.5 +/- 0.7 to 7.1 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 129 +/- 11 minutes, and in the I group, it reduced from 80 +/- 4 to 49 +/- 1 mmHg (10.7 +/- 0.5 to 6.5 +/- 0.1 kPa) for 135 +/- 15 minutes. The average inspiratory concentrations of halothane, enflurane, and isoflurane maintained during hypotension were 0.7 +/- 0.1 vol%, 1.6 +/- 0.2 vol%, and 1.0 +/- 0.1 vol%, respectively. Fentanyl and d-tubocurarine were also administered. Initial labetalol doses were consistent across groups, ranging from 0.52 to 0.59 mg/kg. Heart rate remained stable during the hypotensive phase, with no observed tachy- or bradycardia. Double-blind assessment of bleeding during surgery revealed no significant differences among the groups. Serum creatinine levels rose significantly in all groups during hypotension compared to pre-hypotension values; these levels returned to baseline postoperatively in the halothane and enflurane groups, but not in the isoflurane group.

"Mxi1 Gene Alterations in Human Neurofibrosarcomas. Mxi1, believed to negatively regulate Myc function, is considered a potential tumor suppressor gene. Prior investigations into Mxi1 alterations in human solid tumors have been limited. We analyzed 31 human gastric cancers, 7 esophageal cancers, 85 bone and soft tissue tumors (including 4 neurofibrosarcomas), and 29 human tumor cell lines (comprising 12 esophageal cancers, 7 glioma/glioblastomas, and 10 other types) for Mxi1 mutations within exons 1, 2, 4 (HLH domain), 5, and 6. Polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) followed by sequencing identified three distinct polymorphisms at the intron-exon boundary preceding exon 6. A missense mutation, GCA to GTA (Ala 54 Val), was found in exon 2 in one neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 1). Additionally, two missense mutations, AAA to CAA (Lys 118 Gln) and GAA to GGA (Glu 154 Gly), were detected in exon 5 of a second neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 2). A third neurofibrosarcoma patient (case 3) exhibited three amino acid substitutions: GTG to GCG (Val 179 Ala), GTT to GCT (Val 181 Ala), and TTC to CTC (Phe 186 Leu).

Gene fusions, leading to chromosomal translocations and chimeric transcription factors, are known to contribute to the development of various solid tumors. In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation generates the PAX3/FKHR fusion gene, which expresses a hybrid protein. This protein integrates both the paired box and homeodomain DNA binding domains from PAX3 with the truncated DNA binding domain of FKHR, a forkhead family transcription factor. Our findings demonstrate that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR exhibit comparable, though not identical, transactivation capabilities when assessed using model Pax recognition sequences. While the residual FKHR binding domain within the fusion protein showed no independent functional significance, FKHR was identified as supplying a potent carboxyl terminal activation domain, which substitutes for the domain found in the wild-type PAX3 gene. Furthermore, the native PAX3/FKHR protein observed in tumor cells harboring this translocation exhibits transcriptional properties consistent with the in vitro expressed counterpart. The inherent capacity of the PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein to specifically bind DNA and activate the transcription of artificial reporter genes implies that its anomalous expression may disrupt normal transcriptional pathways governing the proliferation, differentiation, and viability of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo.",0,0,1,1
"Transcriptional Activation by the Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma PAX3/FKHR Fusion Protein. Gene fusions, resulting in chromosomal translocations and the formation of chimeric transcription factors, are recognized contributors to the etiology of various distinct solid tumors. Specifically, the t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma generates the PAX3/FKHR fusion gene. This gene produces a hybrid protein that combines the PAX3 DNA binding domains, including the paired box and homeodomain, with the severed DNA binding domain from FKHR, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family. We demonstrate that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR exhibit comparable, though not identical, transactivation capabilities when evaluated against standard Pax recognition sequences. While the residual FKHR binding domain within the fusion protein lacked an independent functional role, FKHR was found to supply a potent carboxyl terminal activation domain, effectively replacing the one found in the unrearranged PAX3 gene. Importantly, the native PAX3/FKHR protein identified in tumor cells carrying this translocation displays transcriptional properties consistent with its in vitro expressed counterpart. The capacity of the PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein to sequence-specifically bind DNA and transactivate artificial reporter gene expression implies that its aberrant presence may disrupt the essential transcriptional pathways regulating the growth, differentiation, and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo.",0,0,1,1
"Characterization of the Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma PAX3/FKHR Fusion Protein as a Transcriptional Activator. Chimeric transcription factors, arising from gene fusions and subsequent chromosomal translocations, are recognized for their role in the pathogenesis of various distinct solid tumors. Our study focuses on the PAX3/FKHR fusion gene, which is generated by a t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This gene produces a hybrid protein comprising both the paired box and homeodomain DNA binding regions of PAX3, fused to the truncated DNA binding domain of FKHR, a member of the forkhead transcription factor family. We observed that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR exhibit comparable, though not entirely identical, transactivation capabilities when evaluated against model Pax recognition sequences. While no isolated functional contribution was found for the residual FKHR binding domain within the fusion protein, FKHR was shown to provide a robust carboxyl terminal activation domain, substituting for the one present in the wild-type PAX3 gene. Furthermore, the native PAX3/FKHR protein within tumor cells carrying this translocation demonstrates transcriptional characteristics consistent with the protein expressed in vitro.

"PAX3/FKHR Fusion Protein from Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Functions as a Transcriptional Activator. The involvement of chimeric transcription factors, formed through gene fusions via chromosomal translocations, in the pathogenesis of various distinct solid tumors is well-established. In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the t(2;13)(q35;q14) translocation leads to the PAX3/FKHR fusion gene. This gene produces a hybrid protein encompassing the paired box and homeodomain DNA binding regions of PAX3, conjoined with the bisected DNA binding domain of FKHR, which belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors. Our investigation reveals that PAX3 and PAX3/FKHR exhibit comparable, albeit not identical, transactivation activities when assessed with model Pax recognition sequences. No isolated functional contribution was observed for the residual FKHR binding domain within the fusion protein; however, FKHR was determined to provide a potent carboxyl terminal activation domain, serving as a replacement for the domain found in the unaltered PAX3 gene. Furthermore, the native PAX3/FKHR protein found in tumor cells with this translocation demonstrates transcriptional characteristics akin to the protein expressed under in vitro conditions. The demonstrated capacity of the PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein to bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner and to transactivate artificial reporter genes suggests that its anomalous expression has the potential to disrupt the transcriptional programs that naturally govern the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of primitive myogenic precursors in vivo.",0,0,1,1

"Limited Occurrence of BRCA2 Mutations in Breast Carcinoma and Other Malignancies. Inherited mutations in familial tumor suppressor genes confer susceptibility to specific cancer types, and these genes are also frequently targeted by somatic mutations in sporadic forms. However, BRCA1, while a major contributor to familial breast and ovarian cancer, exhibits very low somatic mutation rates in sporadic cases, implying other genes are primary somatic targets in breast carcinoma. BRCA2, another recently identified familial breast cancer gene, contributes to a comparable fraction of breast cancer as BRCA1.

"Temsirolimus's Cytostatic and Anti-Angiogenic Mechanisms in Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), a rare and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, often becomes refractory to standard chemotherapy, leading to a poor prognosis. Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has recently demonstrated a 38% remission rate in this challenging patient population. We investigated a case of refractory MCL that experienced tumor regression within two months of temsirolimus treatment, achieving a progression-free survival of 10 months. Lymph node biopsies, taken prior to and six months following temsirolimus therapy, were compared. This analysis revealed that temsirolimus exerted a cytostatic effect by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest, without altering the number of apoptotic tumor cells. Additionally, an anti-angiogenic effect was observed, characterized by reduced tumor microvessel density and decreased VEGF expression. Furthermore, post-necrotic tissue repair, evidenced by numerous patchy, well-limited fibrotic areas, was identified after six months of temsirolimus treatment.

Nevertheless, the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus has recently shown a 38% remission rate in patients with refractory MCL. We had the opportunity to examine a patient with refractory MCL who demonstrated tumor regression two months post-temsirolimus initiation and achieved a 10-month progression-free survival. Comparative analysis of lymph node biopsies, collected before and six months into temsirolimus therapy, indicated that temsirolimus suppressed tumor cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest, although it did not induce changes in apoptotic tumor cell counts. Beyond this cytostatic action, temsirolimus also exhibited an anti-angiogenic impact, evidenced by a reduction in tumor microvessel density and VEGF expression. Moreover, multiple patchy, distinct fibrotic regions, consistent with post-necrotic tissue repair, were present after six months of temsirolimus treatment.

"Normal APC Allele Loss in FAP-Associated Adrenocortical Carcinoma. Endocrine neoplasms are sporadically reported in patients afflicted with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). This study investigated an adrenocortical carcinoma identified in a patient possessing a family history of FAP. Within this carcinoma, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was identified in the genomic region proximal to the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, indicating the selective loss of its normal allele. This represents the initial documentation of LOH at the APC locus within adrenocortical tumors. These findings, in conjunction with our prior observations of LOH in a recurrent desmoid tumor, suggest that a heterozygous mutant/wild-type state of the APC gene may predispose to benign tumor development, and that the complete functional inactivation of this gene contributes to tumorigenesis not only within the colon but also in diverse extra-colonic sites in FAP patients.",0,0,1,1

"Characterization of Somatic hSNF5/INI1 Mutations in Human Malignancies and Their Genotype-Phenotype Relationships. The hSNF5/INI1 gene, encoding a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, functions as a novel tumor suppressor. Located at 22q11.2, this gene was recently implicated in malignant rhabdoid tumors. Our investigation utilized denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography to screen for hSNF5/INI1 mutations across 229 diverse human tumors. The analysis revealed 31 homozygous deletions and 36 point alterations. Point mutations, distributed throughout the coding region, comprised 15 nonsense, 15 frameshift, three splice site, two missense, and one editing mutation. Mutations were consistently identified in most rhabdoid tumors, regardless of their primary site, suggesting a shared pathogenic origin for these neoplasms. Furthermore, recurrent hSNF5/INI1 alterations were detected in choroid plexus carcinomas, as well as in a subset of central primitive neuroectodermal tumors (cPNETs) and medulloblastomas.

"Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma's PAX3-FKHR Fusion Protein Induces Fibroblast Transformation In Vitro. Pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is characterized by a chromosomal translocation that combines portions of the PAX3 and FKHR genes. PAX3 encodes a transcriptional regulator involved in developmental programs, while FKHR codes for a forkhead-winged helix protein, also presumed to be a transcription factor. The resulting PAX3-FKHR fusion product retains PAX3's DNA binding domains and FKHR's putative activator domain. This PAX3-FKHR protein has been demonstrated to act as a transcriptional activator. Utilizing the RCAS retroviral vector, we introduced the PAX3-FKHR gene into chicken embryo fibroblasts. Expression of the PAX3-FKHR protein in these cells results in their transformation: the cells enlarge, grow with increased density and in multiple layers, and gain the capacity for anchorage-independent growth.

PAX3 codes for a transcriptional regulator overseeing developmental programs, and FKHR produces a forkhead-winged helix protein, presumably a transcription factor. The PAX3-FKHR fusion product maintains the DNA binding domains of PAX3 and the presumed activator domain of FKHR. The PAX3-FKHR protein has been shown to function as an active transcriptional activator. Using the RCAS retroviral vector, we introduced the PAX3-FKHR gene into chicken embryo fibroblasts. Its expression in these cells results in their transformation; the cells enlarge, grow densely packed in multiple layers, and develop the capacity for anchorage-independent proliferation. This cellular transformation observed in vitro is expected to advance research into the mechanism of PAX3-FKHR-mediated oncogenesis.",0,0,1,1
"Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma's PAX3-FKHR Fusion Protein Induces Fibroblast Malignant Transformation In Vitro. A chromosomal translocation uniting sections of the PAX3 and FKHR genes defines pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. PAX3 encodes a transcriptional regulator vital for developmental pathways, and FKHR produces a forkhead-winged helix protein, also considered a likely transcription factor. The resultant PAX3-FKHR fusion protein retains the DNA binding regions of PAX3 and the prospective activator domain from FKHR. The PAX3-FKHR protein is established as a functional transcriptional activator. We introduced the PAX3-FKHR gene into chicken embryo fibroblasts using the RCAS retroviral vector. The protein's expression within these cells prompts their transformation: the cells become visibly larger, proliferate in tightly associated, multi-layered formations, and acquire independence from anchorage for growth. This in vitro cellular alteration will facilitate inquiries into the mechanism of PAX3-FKHR-driven oncogenesis.",0,0,1,1
"Metallothionein Induction's Role in Attenuating Carmustine-Induced Hippocampal Damage and Cognitive Decline in Rats. Hippocampal integrity is crucial for intact cognitive functions. The neuroprotective capacity of metallothionein (MT) induced by ZnSO4 is well-established. This investigation aimed to evaluate the impact of MT induction on carmustine (BCNU)-elicited hippocampal cognitive impairment in rats. Sixty male Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups (15 per group): a control group receiving normal saline (i.c.v) followed by BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 hours; a second group administered ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v, single dose) then BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 hours; a third group given BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose) 24 hours post-normal saline (i.c.v) injection; and a fourth group receiving a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v) followed by BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose) after 24 hours. Data demonstrated that BCNU exposure led to deficits in learning and short-term memory (STM), assessed via the radial arm water maze, concurrently with diminished hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, BCNU administration elevated serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, alongside increased caspase-3 activity and observable histological changes. ZnSO4 pretreatment mitigated BCNU-induced GR inhibition and GSH depletion, resulting in a significant decrease in MDA and TNFalpha levels as well as caspase-3 activity. Hippocampal histological features were also improved in rats treated with ZnSO4 + BCNU compared to those receiving BCNU alone. In conclusion, MT induction curtails BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity by preventing GR inhibition and GSH depletion, and by counteracting the elevations in TNFalpha, MDA, and caspase-3 activity, thereby preserving cognitive function.",0,0,1,1
"Neuroprotective Effects of Metallothionein Induction Against Carmustine-Induced Cognitive and Hippocampal Damage in Rats. The integrity of the hippocampus is fundamental for cognitive functions. Metallothionein (MT) induction by zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) has been documented for its neuroprotective role. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MT induction on hippocampal cognitive impairment induced by carmustine (BCNU) in a rat model. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups (15 rats/group): The first group served as control, receiving normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 hours later by BCNU solvent (i.v). The second group was given ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v, once), then BCNU solvent (i.v) 24 hours later. The third group was treated with BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) 24 hours after an i.c.v injection of normal saline. The fourth group received a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v) followed by BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, once) after 24 hours. The results showed that BCNU administration led to impaired learning and short-term memory (STM), evaluated using a radial arm water maze. This was associated with decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Additionally, BCNU increased serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, along with elevated caspase-3 activity and histological alterations. Pretreatment with ZnSO4 reversed the BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH, and significantly lowered the levels of MDA and TNFalpha, as well as caspase-3 activity. Histological improvements were observed in the hippocampi of rats treated with ZnSO4 + BCNU compared to those treated with BCNU alone. In conclusion, inducing MT effectively arrests BCNU-mediated hippocampal toxicity by preventing GR inhibition and GSH depletion, and by counteracting the rise in TNFalpha, MDA, and caspase-3 activity, thereby ensuring the preservation of cognition.",0,0,1,1
"Counteracting Carmustine-Induced Neurotoxicity with Metallothionein Induction: Preserving Cognition and Hippocampal Structure in Rats. The integral role of hippocampal function in cognitive processes is well-recognized. Furthermore, the neuroprotective capacity of metallothionein (MT), inducible by ZnSO4, has been documented. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of MT induction in mitigating carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive dysfunction in a rat model. A total of 60 male Wistar albino rats were randomly allocated into four groups (15 per group): A control group received normal saline (i.c.v) followed 24 hours later by BCNU solvent (i.v). A second group was administered ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v, single dose) prior to BCNU solvent (i.v) after 24 hours. A third group was given BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose) 24 hours after an i.c.v injection of normal saline. The fourth group received a single i.c.v dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline) followed 24 hours later by BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose). The findings demonstrated that BCNU administration led to impaired learning and short-term memory (STM), as evidenced by radial arm water maze performance. This impairment was accompanied by reduced hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and decreased glutathione (GSH) content. Additionally, BCNU treatment elevated serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and enhanced caspase-3 activity, alongside inducing histological alterations. Pretreatment with ZnSO4 effectively counteracted BCNU-induced GR inhibition and GSH depletion, leading to significant reductions in MDA, TNFalpha levels, and caspase-3 activity. Histological features within the hippocampus were also enhanced in rats treated with ZnSO4 + BCNU when compared to BCNU-only animals. In conclusion, the induction of MT offers a protective mechanism against BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity by preventing GR inhibition and GSH depletion, and by antagonizing the increases in TNFalpha, MDA, and caspase-3 activity, thereby safeguarding cognitive function.",0,0,1,1
"Efficacy of Metallothionein Induction in Preserving Cognitive Function and Hippocampal Neuronal Integrity in Carmustine-Treated Rats. The structural integrity of the hippocampus is indispensable for cognitive functions. The neuroprotective effects of metallothionein (MT) induction via ZnSO4 have previously been established. This study sought to ascertain the efficacy of MT induction in mitigating carmustine (BCNU)-induced hippocampal cognitive impairment in rats. Sixty male Wistar albino rats were randomly assigned to four groups, each comprising 15 animals: The control group received normal saline (i.c.v) followed by BCNU solvent (i.v) 24 hours later. The second group was administered ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v, single dose) before BCNU solvent (i.v) 24 hours subsequent. The third group received BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose) 24 hours after an i.c.v injection of normal saline. The fourth group was given a single dose of ZnSO4 (0.1 µmol/10 µl normal saline, i.c.v) followed by BCNU (20 mg/kg, i.v, single dose) after 24 hours. Experimental data indicated that BCNU administration resulted in compromised learning and short-term memory (STM) performance, as measured by the radial arm water maze. These cognitive deficits were accompanied by decreased hippocampal glutathione reductase (GR) activity and reduced glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, BCNU elevated serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), increased hippocampal MT and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and augmented caspase-3 activity, in addition to causing histological alterations. Pretreatment with ZnSO4 counteracted the BCNU-induced inhibition of GR and depletion of GSH, leading to a significant decrease in MDA levels, TNFalpha levels, and caspase-3 activity. Histological characteristics of the hippocampus were also improved in rats treated with ZnSO4 + BCNU compared to those receiving BCNU alone. Conclusively, MT induction effectively inhibits BCNU-induced hippocampal toxicity by preventing GR inhibition and GSH depletion, and by counteracting the elevated levels of TNFalpha, MDA, and caspase-3 activity, thereby leading to the preservation of cognition.",0,0,1,1
"Embryonic Lethality and Neuroepithelial Defects Caused by Brca1 Deficiency. The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1, which encodes a zinc-finger protein of undetermined function, has been cloned. BRCA1 mutations are responsible for at least 80% of families affected by both breast and ovarian cancer, alongside certain sporadic ovarian cancers that are not familial. The observation of wild-type BRCA1 loss in tumors from individuals with a single nonfunctional BRCA1 allele indicates that BRCA1 functions as a tumor suppressor, potentially inhibiting mammary epithelial cell proliferation. To investigate BRCA1's role in normal tissue development and differentiation, and to establish a potential model for the cancer susceptibility linked to BRCA1 function loss, a mouse line was generated carrying a mutation in one Brca1 allele. Analysis of mice homozygous for this mutant allele demonstrated Brca1's essential role in normal development, as these mice succumbed in utero between 10 and 13 days of gestation (E10-E13). Abnormalities in Brca1-deficient embryos were most prominent within the neural tube, with 40% of embryos displaying various degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly. Furthermore, the neuroepithelium in Brca1-deficient embryos exhibited disorganization, marked by indicators of both accelerated proliferation and heightened cell death.",0,0,1,1
"Brca1's Role in Early Embryonic Development: Lethality and Neuroepithelial Dysregulation. The gene BRCA1, known for its association with breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility, has been cloned and identified as encoding a zinc-finger protein whose precise function remains to be elucidated. Mutations within BRCA1 are implicated in at least 80% of families with concurrent breast and ovarian cancer, as well as in some cases of sporadic ovarian cancer not linked to family history. The absence of wild-type BRCA1 in tumors of individuals possessing one nonfunctional BRCA1 allele implies that BRCA1 acts as a tumor suppressor, potentially regulating the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. To assess BRCA1's involvement in physiological tissue growth and differentiation, and to develop a prospective model for the cancer susceptibility resulting from impaired BRCA1 function, we engineered a mouse line bearing a mutation in one Brca1 allele. Examination of mice homozygous for the mutated allele confirmed Brca1's critical importance for proper development, given that these mice expired during gestation, specifically between embryonic days 10 and 13. Deficiencies in Brca1-null embryos were predominantly observed in the neural tube, where 40% of embryos manifested diverse degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly. Additionally, the neuroepithelium of Brca1-deficient embryos appeared disordered, exhibiting signs indicative of both increased proliferative activity and excessive apoptotic processes.",0,0,1,1
"Consequences of Brca1 Gene Deficiency: Embryonic Demise and Neural Tube Defects. The gene BRCA1, a known susceptibility factor for breast and ovarian cancer, has been successfully cloned and is recognized for encoding a zinc-finger protein with an as-yet-undetermined biological role. Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 account for a substantial proportion, specifically at least 80%, of families presenting with both breast and ovarian cancer, and are also found in a subset of non-familial sporadic ovarian cancers. The observed loss of the functional wild-type BRCA1 allele in tumors from individuals carrying one compromised BRCA1 allele suggests its role as a tumor suppressor, potentially by restricting the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. To investigate the physiological contribution of BRCA1 to tissue growth and differentiation, and to create a relevant model for the cancer predisposition linked to the absence of BRCA1 function, we engineered a mouse strain with a mutation in one Brca1 allele. Investigations into mice homozygous for this mutant allele revealed that Brca1 is indispensable for normal embryogenesis, as these animals exhibited intrauterine demise between gestational days 10 and 13 (E10-E13). Morphological irregularities in Brca1-deficient embryos were most pronounced within the neural tube, with 40% of embryos demonstrating varying manifestations of spina bifida and anencephaly.

"Experimental Evidence for Brca1's Essential Role in Embryonic Survival and Neurodevelopment. The BRCA1 gene, identified as a susceptibility factor for breast and ovarian cancer, has been isolated and found to encode a zinc-finger protein whose specific function remains uncharacterized. Mutations in BRCA1 are implicated in over 80% of families affected by both breast and ovarian cancer, as well as in some sporadic cases of ovarian cancer. The observed inactivation of the wild-type BRCA1 allele in tumors of individuals inheriting a nonfunctional BRCA1 allele supports its classification as a tumor suppressor, likely responsible for inhibiting the proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. To explore BRCA1's involvement in normal tissue development and differentiation, and to establish an experimental system for studying cancer susceptibility linked to Brca1 functional loss, a mouse model was generated carrying a specific mutation in one Brca1 allele. Analysis of mice homozygous for this mutant allele demonstrated the critical necessity of Brca1 for proper development, given their demise in utero between embryonic days 10 and 13. The most pronounced abnormalities in Brca1-deficient embryos were located in the neural tube, with 40% exhibiting different degrees of spina bifida and anencephaly.

"ATM's Critical Involvement in Radiation Response and Cell Cycle Regulation. The ATM gene, mutated in ataxia-telangiectasia, encodes a potential protein or lipid kinase. To clarify its functions, we genetically engineered mice lacking the ATM gene through homologous recombination. Consistent with observed cellular anomalies in AT patients, ATM-deficient cells exhibited heightened sensitivity to gamma-irradiation and impaired cell-cycle arrest following radiation exposure, correlating with deficient p53 up-regulation. Furthermore, ATM-knockout mouse thymocytes demonstrated increased resistance to gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis compared to wild-type thymocytes. ATM-null fibroblasts showed inefficient G1 to S-phase progression after serum stimulation and underwent senescence after limited passages in culture. These cells also presented elevated constitutive levels of p21CP1/WAF1. These findings establish the ATM protein's crucial role in both cellular reactions to ionizing radiation and in maintaining normal cell-cycle progression. ATM heterozygous fibroblasts and thymocytes displayed partially compromised responses to irradiation but no growth defects, suggesting that the heightened cancer risk in AT heterozygotes might stem from inadequate checkpoint functionality.",0,0,1,1
"Elucidating ATM's Contributions to Radiation Response and Cell Growth Control Mechanisms. Ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) patients carry mutations in the ATM gene, which codes for a putative protein or lipid kinase. Our investigation aimed to delineate ATM's functions by disrupting the ATM gene in mice via homologous recombination. In line with the cellular phenotypes seen in AT patients, ATM-deficient (ATM-/-) cells displayed elevated susceptibility to gamma-irradiation and failed to properly arrest the cell cycle post-radiation, which corresponded with a compromised p53 up-regulation. Additionally, ATM-null mouse thymocytes were more resilient to gamma-irradiation-induced apoptosis than their normal counterparts. ATM-deficient fibroblasts experienced hindered G1 to S-phase transition after serum stimulation and reached senescence after only a few cultural passages. These fibroblasts also exhibited an increased basal level of p21CP1/WAF1. Collectively, these results underscore the ATM protein's indispensable role in both the cellular responses to ionizing radiation and the regulation of normal cell-cycle progression. Interestingly, ATM+/– fibroblasts and thymocytes showed intermediate deficits in their responses to irradiation but no observable growth defects, suggesting that the elevated cancer susceptibility in AT heterozygotes could be linked to suboptimal checkpoint function.",0,0,1,1

"Localizing the breast-ovarian cancer syndrome to a narrow region on chromosome 17q12-21: ruling out EDH17B2 and RARA as candidate genes. The susceptibility gene BRCA1, associated with hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, has previously been mapped to chromosome 17q21 through linkage analysis. Potential candidate genes within this region include EDH17B2, which encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (17 beta-HSD II), and RARA, coding for retinoic acid receptor alpha. We analyzed 22 families affected by breast and breast-ovarian cancer, utilizing eight polymorphisms from the 17q12-21 chromosomal region, with two located within the EDH17B2 gene. Genetic recombination with the breast cancer phenotype indicates that RARA is not a suitable candidate gene for BRCA1. Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 were mapped to a 6 cM interval between THRA1 and D17S579, and no recombination was observed between these two genes. However, direct sequencing of the entire EDH17B2 gene, performed on overlapping PCR products from four unrelated affected women, revealed no sequence alterations beyond previously documented polymorphisms. Consequently, mutations in the EDH17B2 gene do not appear to contribute to the hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome.

Previous linkage analysis established BRCA1, a hereditary breast-ovarian cancer susceptibility gene, at chromosome 17q21. Among the candidate genes in this segment are EDH17B2, responsible for encoding estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (17 beta-HSD II), and RARA, which codes for retinoic acid receptor alpha. Our study involved genotyping 22 breast and breast-ovarian cancer families using eight polymorphisms within the chromosome 17q12-21 region, two of which were in the EDH17B2 gene. Recombination events with the breast cancer trait led to the exclusion of RARA as a potential candidate for BRCA1. Both BRCA1 and EDH17B2 were found to map within a 6 cM interval (located between THRA1 and D17S579), with no recombination detected between them. Nevertheless, direct sequencing of the complete EDH17B2 gene, using overlapping PCR products from four unrelated affected women, identified no novel sequence variations apart from known polymorphisms.

"Centrosome Over-replication and G2-M Checkpoint Dysfunction as Inducers of Genetic Instability in BRCA1 Exon 11 Isoform-Lacking Cells. Germline mutations in the Brca1 tumor suppressor gene confer susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancers in women.

Our findings indicate that these mutant cells maintain an intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint but exhibit impaired proliferation. Notably, a compromised G2-M checkpoint in these cells correlates with extensive chromosomal aberrations. Furthermore, the mutant fibroblasts possess numerous functional centrosomes, which contribute to unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, and aneuploidy.

"Gene-Specific Mechanisms Drive Fusion Gene Overexpression from Alternative Translocations in Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Chromosomal translocations in various tumors can cause protooncogene dysregulation or oncogenic chimeric protein formation. Specifically, in pediatric alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the t(2;13) or t(1;13) translocations produce PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins, respectively. This study demonstrates that these translocations not only lead to functional changes but also to the overexpression of the fusion products. Furthermore, the overexpression of PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR results from distinct processes. PAX3-FKHR transcription is elevated compared to wild-type PAX3 through a copy number-independent pathway. Conversely, PAX7-FKHR overexpression is a consequence of fusion gene amplification. Therefore, gene-specific strategies have evolved to achieve PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR overexpression in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, likely reflecting differences in the regulation of their respective wild-type loci. We propose that these diverse overexpression mechanisms are crucial for maintaining the requisite level of gene product necessary for the oncogenic effects of these fusion genes.",0,0,1,1
"Distinct Regulatory Strategies for Fusion Gene Overexpression Arising from Alternative Chromosomal Translocations in Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma. Chromosomal translocations observed in both hematopoietic and solid malignancies lead to the dysregulated expression of protooncogenes or the generation of chimeric proteins possessing tumorigenic potential. In alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric solid tumor, the characteristic t(2;13) (q35;q14) or variant t(1;13) (p36;q14) translocations give rise to PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins. Here, we report that these translocations are associated with overexpression of the fusion products, in addition to inducing functional alterations. Significantly, PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR are overexpressed via separate mechanisms. Increased transcription of PAX3-FKHR relative to wild-type PAX3 occurs through a mechanism independent of gene copy number. In contrast, PAX7-FKHR overexpression is attributable to the amplification of its fusion gene. Consequently, gene-specific regulatory strategies appear to have been selected for the overexpression of PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, possibly reflecting differences in regulation between the parental gene loci. We hypothesize that these overexpression mechanisms are essential for ensuring a critical concentration of the gene product, which is vital for the oncogenic impact of these fusions.",0,0,1,1
"Mechanistic Basis for Fusion Gene Overexpression in Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma Due to Alternative Chromosomal Translocations. Chromosomal translocations found in hematopoietic and solid tumors result in the aberrant expression of protooncogenes or the formation of novel chimeric proteins with oncogenic capacity. In the context of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a pediatric solid tumor, the defining t(2;13) (q35;q14) or variant t(1;13) (p36;q14) translocation creates the PAX3-FKHR or PAX7-FKHR fusion proteins. This investigation reveals that, beyond their functional alterations, these translocations are linked to the overexpression of the fusion products. Moreover, the overexpression of PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR proceeds through distinct molecular pathways. Specifically, PAX3-FKHR transcription is augmented when compared to wild-type PAX3 through a process not dependent on gene copy number. Conversely, the increased expression of PAX7-FKHR stems from the amplification of its fusion gene. Thus, specific genetic mechanisms have been employed to achieve overexpression of PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, presumably due to inherent differences in the regulation of their wild-type counterparts. We posit that these varied overexpression mechanisms are crucial for delivering a sufficient level of gene product to facilitate the oncogenic activities of these fusions.",0,0,1,1

"The Association of p19/nm23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Abundance with Cell Proliferation. The nm23-H1 gene, which codes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has demonstrated varied associations with metastasis; high expression has correlated with reduced metastasis in some tumors but not in others. We previously identified p19/nm23 as the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene via two-dimensional electrophoretic gels. In neuroblastoma, elevated p19/nm23 levels were observed in advanced stage tumors compared to limited stage disease, coinciding with N-myc oncogene amplification, larger tumor mass, and metastasis. Given the inconsistent expression patterns of nm23-H1 across different tumors, we investigated the relationship between this protein's quantity and cellular proliferation. p19/nm23 levels were compared in quiescent versus mitotically active normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) and in leukemia cells. A rise in p19/nm23 protein was noted in normal lymphocytes in response to mitotic stimulation, mirroring the increase in DNA synthesis. Similarly, leukemia cells from patients with diverse acute leukemia subtypes showed elevated p19/nm23 levels compared to resting normal lymphocytes. Treatment of mitotically stimulated lymphocytes with cyclosporin, a known proliferation inhibitor, prevented the p19/nm23 increase. Conversely, inducing terminal differentiation with dimethylsulfoxide in the HL-60 leukemia cell line led to a decrease in p19/nm23 levels. These findings collectively suggest that nm23-H1 expression is directly linked to cellular proliferative activity.",0,0,1,1
"Regulation of p19/nm23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Expression by Cell Proliferation. The gene nm23-H1, encoding a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has been observed to have high expression correlating with reduced metastasis in certain tumor types, but not universally. Our prior research identified p19/nm23 as the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene using two-dimensional electrophoresis. In cases of neuroblastoma, advanced stage tumors displayed higher concentrations of p19/nm23, a finding associated with N-myc oncogene amplification, larger tumor volume, and metastatic progression, in contrast to limited stage disease. Motivated by the disparate expression of nm23-H1 across various tumors, we undertook an investigation into the connection between the protein's quantity and cellular proliferative status. We compared p19/nm23 concentrations in normal human PBLs when at rest versus under mitotic stimulation, and within leukemia cells. Normal lymphocytes exhibited an elevation in p19/nm23 levels concurrent with mitotic stimulation, which tracked the surge in DNA synthesis. Furthermore, p19/nm23 levels were also elevated in leukemia cells obtained from patients with different subtypes of acute leukemia, relative to resting normal lymphocytes. The increase in p19/nm23 in mitotically stimulated lymphocytes was abrogated by treatment with cyclosporin, an agent known to inhibit proliferation. Conversely, inducing terminal differentiation with dimethylsulfoxide in the HL-60 leukemia cell line led to a reduction in p19/nm23 concentrations. These data collectively substantiate that nm23-H1 expression is modulated by cell proliferative activity.",0,0,1,1
"Cellular Proliferation and the Expression Profile of p19/nm23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase. Expression of the nm23-H1 gene, which codes for a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has shown an inconsistent correlation with metastatic potential; high expression linked to reduced metastasis in some tumor contexts but not others. Our team previously identified p19/nm23 as the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene through two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis. In neuroblastoma, advanced stage tumors exhibited higher levels of p19/nm23 compared to limited stage disease, a characteristic associated with N-myc oncogene amplification, significant tumor burden, and metastasis. Given this context of varied nm23-H1 expression across different neoplasms, we undertook an examination of the connection between the protein's quantity and cell proliferation. We assessed p19/nm23 levels in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) in both resting and mitotically stimulated states, as well as in leukemia cells. An elevation of p19/nm23 was observed in normal lymphocytes following mitotic stimulation, occurring in parallel with an increase in DNA synthesis. Similarly, leukemia cells procured from patients diagnosed with various acute leukemia subtypes also demonstrated elevated p19/nm23 levels compared to quiescent normal lymphocytes. Cyclosporin treatment, which suppresses proliferation, prevented the rise in p19/nm23 in mitotically stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, the induction of terminal differentiation with dimethylsulfoxide in the HL-60 leukemia cell line led to decreased p19/nm23 levels. These findings robustly indicate that nm23-H1 expression is intimately connected to cellular proliferative activity.",0,0,1,1
"Proliferative Activity as a Determinant of p19/nm23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinase Levels. Elevated expression of the nm23-H1 gene, which encodes a nucleoside diphosphate kinase, has been linked to reduced metastasis in certain tumor types, yet this correlation is not universal. Our prior work successfully identified p19/nm23 as the protein product of the nm23-H1 gene through two-dimensional electrophoretic separation. Notably, in neuroblastoma, advanced stage tumors presented with higher concentrations of p19/nm23, a phenomenon correlated with N-myc oncogene amplification, increased tumor size, and metastasis, contrasting with findings in limited stage disease. Recognizing the inconsistent expression of nm23-H1 across diverse tumors, we sought to elucidate the relationship between this protein's quantity and cellular proliferation. The concentrations of p19/nm23 were evaluated in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) under quiescent and mitotically stimulated conditions, as well as in leukemia cells. In normal lymphocytes, p19/nm23 content escalated in response to mitotic stimulation, mirroring the upward trend in DNA synthesis. Similarly, leukemia cells derived from patients afflicted with various forms of acute leukemia displayed heightened p19/nm23 levels when compared to quiescent normal lymphocytes. Administration of cyclosporin, an inhibitor of proliferation, prevented the increase in p19/nm23 observed in mitotically stimulated lymphocytes. Furthermore, inducing terminal differentiation in the HL-60 leukemia cell line with dimethylsulfoxide led to a decline in p19/nm23 concentrations. Consequently, our findings establish that nm23-H1 expression is intrinsically associated with cell proliferative activity.",0,0,1,1
"Maternal Intrachromosomal Insertion Leading to Chromosome 5 Deletion and Adenomatous Polyposis Coli. This report details the clinical and laboratory characteristics of an institutionalized adult patient initially evaluated for autism. Colorectal cancer risk was anticipated following the identification of an interstitial deletion, del(5)(q15q22.3), within the long arm of chromosome 5 in her lymphocytes, with molecular analysis substantiating the deletion of MCC and APC genes.

"Phase II Evaluation of Thalidomide in Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma. This study aimed to assess the toxicity and therapeutic efficacy of thalidomide in patients presenting with advanced metastatic renal cell cancer, along with measuring alterations in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 levels during treatment. Twenty-nine patients were recruited and administered thalidomide via an intra-patient dose escalation regimen, commencing at 400 mg/d and progressing to 1200 mg/d by day 54 as tolerated. Prior IL-2 therapy had been received by 59% of patients, and 52% exhibited a performance status of 2 or 3.

"VHL Gene Mutations in Sporadic Renal Cell Carcinoma: Identifying a Risk Profile for RCC Development in VHL Patients. Our study aimed to characterize somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations, examining 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for VHL tumor suppressor gene alterations. We employed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of DNA for this purpose. Abnormal SSCP patterns were observed in 73 samples. Subsequent sequencing revealed microdeletions in 58% of instances, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17%. Half of these identified mutations represented novel findings. Consistent with prior reports, VHL mutations were exclusively detected in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype. A comparison between somatic and germline mutations, utilizing a VHL database of 507 entries, demonstrated a significant disparity (P < 0.0001) in mutational events. Specifically, mutations resulting in truncated proteins constituted 78% of somatic mutations compared to only 37% of germline mutations. This suggests a distinct pattern of VHL mutations linked to sporadic RCC, predominantly involving protein truncations with a limited number of specific missense changes. Further analysis investigated RCC incidence within VHL families, stratified by mutation type. RCC was present in at least one family member in 77% of cases with protein-truncating mutations, significantly higher than the 55% observed in cases with missense mutations (P = 0.015).

Investigating RCC occurrence within VHL families, stratified by mutation type, revealed that 77% of families with protein-truncating mutations had at least one member with RCC, significantly exceeding the 55% observed in families with missense mutations (P = 0.015). Our findings conclude that VHL mutations resulting in truncated proteins confer a significantly higher risk of RCC in VHL patients.",0,1,0,1
"VHL Gene Mutations in Sporadic RCC: Defining a Higher-Risk Mutational Profile for VHL Patients. The characteristics of somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations were investigated by analyzing the VHL tumor suppressor gene in 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of DNA were utilized for this investigation. An abnormal SSCP pattern was observed in 73 of the samples. Subsequent sequencing revealed microdeletions in 58%, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17% of positive cases. Half of these identified mutations constituted novel discoveries. As previously documented, VHL mutations were exclusively confined to the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype. A comparative analysis of somatic and germline mutations, leveraging the VHL database containing 507 entries, demonstrated a significant difference (P < 0.0001) in mutational events. Specifically, mutations resulting in truncated proteins were present in 78% of somatic mutations but only 37% of germline mutations. This indicates a distinct VHL mutation pattern linked to sporadic RCC, characterized predominantly by protein truncations and a limited number of specific missense changes. Further investigation into RCC prevalence within VHL families, categorised by mutation type, showed that 77% of families with protein-truncating mutations had at least one member with RCC, significantly higher than the 55% observed in families with missense mutations (P = 0.015). This suggests that VHL mutations leading to truncated proteins represent a significantly elevated risk factor for RCC development in VHL patients.",0,1,0,1
"Characterization of VHL Gene Mutations in Sporadic Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Risk Indicator for RCC in VHL Patients. The somatic mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene were investigated in 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas. The VHL tumor suppressor gene was analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of DNA. An abnormal SSCP pattern was identified in 73 samples. Subsequent sequencing revealed microdeletions in 58%, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17% of the cases. Fifty percent of the discovered mutations were previously uncharacterized. As reported previously, VHL mutations were observed exclusively in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype. A comparison of somatic and germline mutations, referencing a VHL database of 507 mutations, indicated a significant divergence (P < 0.0001) in mutational events. Truncating mutations represented 78% of somatic mutations, significantly higher than the 37% found in germline mutations. This suggests a specific pattern of VHL mutations correlating with sporadic RCC, primarily characterized by protein truncations and a small number of distinct missense mutations. The incidence of RCC in VHL families was then evaluated based on mutation characteristics. RCC was present in at least one member in 77% of VHL families with protein-truncating mutations, in contrast to 55% in families with missense mutations (P = 0.015). This finding establishes that mutations causing truncated proteins confer a significantly elevated risk of RCC in VHL patients.",0,1,0,1

"Evaluation of the thymidylate synthase inhibitor CB 3717 (N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid) in preclinical and early clinical investigations. N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717) functions as a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), with its cytotoxic effects solely attributed to this enzyme inhibition. Recent preclinical research has investigated the intracellular formation of CB 3717 polyglutamates. After exposing L1210 cells to 50 microM [3H]CB 3717 for 12 hours, high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses revealed that 30% of the recoverable radioactivity comprised CB 3717 tetra- and pentaglutamate. When tested against isolated L1210 TS, CB 3717 di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaglutamate demonstrated significantly increased potency, being 26-, 87-, 119-, and 114-fold more potent than CB 3717, respectively, suggesting their formation may critically influence CB 3717's cytotoxicity. Initial clinical trials with CB 3717 have shown efficacy in cases of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Adverse effects included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity, with the latter potentially resulting from drug precipitation in the renal tubules due to CB 3717's poor solubility in acidic conditions. To address this issue, a clinical trial is currently evaluating CB 3717 administration alongside alkaline diuresis. Preliminary findings from doses of 400 and 500 mg/m2 indicate a potential reduction in nephrotoxicity, with only 1 out of 10 patients experiencing renal toxicity. Hepatotoxicity and malaise remain the most common side effects. Antitumor activity has been observed in 3 patients. Pharmacokinetic analyses confirm that alkaline diuresis does not alter CB 3717 plasma concentrations or urinary excretion, and successful urinary alkalinization is achievable.",0,1,0,1
"N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid (CB 3717), a thymidylate synthase inhibitor: Preclinical insights and clinical observations. CB 3717, chemically known as N10-propargyl-5,8-dideazafolic acid, operates as a potent, tight-binding inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS), with its cytotoxic action exclusively originating from this enzyme inhibition.

As inhibitors of isolated L1210 TS, the di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaglutamate forms of CB 3717 exhibited dramatically increased potency, being 26, 87, 119, and 114 times more potent than CB 3717 itself, respectively, implying that their formation might be a crucial determinant of CB 3717's cellular toxicity. In early-stage clinical evaluations of CB 3717, therapeutic effects have been documented in individuals with breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Noted adverse events included hepatotoxicity, general malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity. This kidney-related side effect is theorized to stem from the precipitation of the drug within the renal tubules, a consequence of CB 3717's poor solubility in acidic environments.

Preliminary data from doses of 400 and 500 mg/m2 suggest a possible amelioration of nephrotoxicity, with only 1 patient out of 10 experiencing renal toxicity.

This increased potency suggests that their formation plays a significant role in CB 3717 cytotoxicity. In initial clinical evaluations of CB 3717, therapeutic activity has been noted in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, hepatoma, and mesothelioma. Observed toxicities included hepatotoxicity, malaise, and dose-limiting nephrotoxicity.

"Renal Impairment Following High-Dose Methotrexate Therapy in a Patient with Ileostomy. High-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) serves as a crucial treatment for Burkitt lymphoma but can induce hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is delayed. We document a case of acute kidney injury occurring after HD-MTX administration in a patient with an ileostomy. The patient was a 3-year-old boy who had received a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. On day 833 post-transplantation, he was diagnosed with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD, Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma). During initial induction therapy, he developed an ileal perforation, necessitating an ileostomy. Subsequent HD-MTX therapy led to acute renal failure, which mandated continuous hemodialysis. We proposed that intravascular hypovolemia, resulting from significant fluid loss from the ileostoma, caused acute prerenal failure. Following the recovery of his renal function, the patient was safely treated with further HD-MTX cycles by carefully controlling drainage from the ileostoma using total parenteral nutrition.",0,1,0,1
"Acute Kidney Injury Secondary to High-Dose Methotrexate Administration in an Ileostomized Patient.

The patient was a 3-year-old male, diagnosed with PTLD (Burkitt-type malignant lymphoma) 833 days after a living-related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresia. An ileal perforation during induction therapy required an ileostomy to be formed. The subsequent HD-MTX regimen precipitated acute renal failure, thereby requiring continuous hemodialysis.

"Transient Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy in Cancer Patients Receiving Continuous 5-Fluorouracil, with Dehydration and Infection. From 1986 to 1998, 29 cancer patients experienced 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy linked to continuous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. None of these individuals had pre-existing decompensated liver disease. Encephalopathy onset ranged from 0.5 to 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) following chemotherapy initiation.

In 25 of 32 episodes (78%), plasma ammonium levels and mental status normalized within two days of appropriate management. In conclusion, hyperammonemic encephalopathy is a potential complication for patients receiving continuous 5-FU infusion. Azotemia, insufficient body fluids, and bacterial infections were commonly identified among these patients, underscoring the importance of recognizing this condition in individuals undergoing continuous 5-FU therapy.",0,1,0,1
"Predisposing Factors for Transient Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy in Cancer Patients Undergoing Continuous 5-Fluorouracil Therapy. A review of cases from 1986 to 1998 identified 32 instances of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy (THE) across 29 cancer patients receiving continuous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. No patient presented with decompensated liver disease. The encephalopathy typically developed between 0.5 and 5 days (average: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after chemotherapy initiation. Plasma ammonium concentrations ranged from 248 to 2387 µg% (average: 626 +/- 431 µg%). A breakdown of the 32 episodes revealed that 26 (81%) involved azotemia of varying severity, 18 (56%) transpired during bacterial infections, and 14 (44%) occurred in dehydrated patients without concurrent infection. Statistically significant associations were found: higher plasma ammonium levels and more rapid onset of hyperammonemia were observed in 18 patients with bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively) and in nine patients on high daily 5-FU doses (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). Clinical resolution, characterized by normalized plasma ammonium levels and mental status, was achieved within 2 days following management in 25 of the 32 episodes (78%).

"Clinical Features and Management Outcomes of Transient Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy in 5-Fluorouracil-Treated Cancer Patients with Dehydration and Infection. A retrospective study spanning 1986 to 1998 documented 32 episodes of transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy, affecting 29 cancer patients receiving continuous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusions. No cases involved patients with decompensated liver disease. The encephalopathy typically presented between 0.5 and 5 days (mean: 2.6 +/- 1.3 days) after chemotherapy initiation, with plasma ammonium levels ranging from 248 to 2387 µg% (mean: 626 +/- 431 µg%). Of the 32 documented episodes, azotemia was present in 26 (81%), bacterial infections complicated 18 (56%) cases, and dehydration without infection was observed in 14 (44%) instances. Statistically significant associations were identified between elevated plasma ammonium levels and a more rapid onset of hyperammonemia in 18 patients experiencing bacterial infections (p=0.003 and 0.0006, respectively). Similar associations were noted in nine patients receiving high daily doses of 5-FU (2600 or 1800 mg/m2) (p=0.0001 and < 0.0001, respectively). Successful resolution, marked by a return to normal plasma ammonium levels and mental status within two days of appropriate intervention, was achieved in 25 out of 32 episodes (78%). These findings confirm that hyperammonemic encephalopathy can arise in patients undergoing continuous 5-FU infusion. Azotemia, hypovolemia, and bacterial infections frequently accompany this condition, thus emphasizing the criticality of early detection in patients receiving continuous 5-FU.",0,1,0,1
"Transient Hyperammonemic Encephalopathy in Continuous 5-Fluorouracil Therapy: The Role of Dehydration and Infection. Transient hyperammonemic encephalopathy (THE) linked to continuous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion was observed in 32 episodes among 29 cancer patients between 1986 and 1998. Patients with decompensated liver disease were excluded from this cohort. The onset of THE occurred between 0.5 and 5 days after chemotherapy commenced, with a mean of 2.6 +/- 1.3 days. Plasma ammonium levels ranged from 248 to 2387 µg%, averaging 626 +/- 431 µg%. Analysis of the 32 episodes showed azotemia in 26 (81%) cases, bacterial infections in 18 (56%), and dehydration without infection in 14 (44%). Both bacterial infections (18 patients; p=0.003 for higher plasma ammonium, p=0.0006 for rapid onset) and high daily doses of 5-FU (9 patients receiving 2600 or 1800 mg/m2; p=0.0001 for higher plasma ammonium, p < 0.0001 for rapid onset) were significantly associated with higher plasma ammonium concentrations and faster encephalopathy development. Importantly, 25 of 32 episodes (78%) saw a return to normal plasma ammonium levels and mental status within two days following effective management. This study concludes that continuous 5-FU infusion can precipitate hyperammonemic encephalopathy. Given the frequent co-occurrence of azotemia, dehydration, and bacterial infections, clinicians should be vigilant for this condition in patients receiving continuous 5-FU.",0,1,0,1

"The Therapeutic Potential of GEM-P Chemotherapy in Recurrent Hodgkin Lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) typically responds well to chemotherapy; however, for patients experiencing relapse, high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation is the preferred approach, contingent upon adequate disease control achieved through salvage chemotherapy. Conventional regimens are often administered inpatient and are associated with significant toxicity, posing challenges for delivery. Gemcitabine and cisplatin demonstrate efficacy in HL, exhibit distinct toxicity profiles from first-line agents, and can potentially be administered in an outpatient setting. This retrospective, single-centre analysis enrolled 41 eligible patients (median age 27) with relapsed or refractory HL who received gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m² on days 1, 8, and 15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg on days 1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m² on day 15, on a 28-day cycle (GEM-P). Demographic, survival, response, and toxicity data were collected. A total of 122 cycles of GEM-P were given (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Of these patients, 20 (48%) received GEM-P as second-line therapy and 11 (27%) as third-line treatment. The overall response rate (ORR) for the entire cohort was 80% (37% complete response (CR), 44% partial response), with 14 of 15 CRs confirmed as metabolic CR via PET scan, and an ORR of 85% in the 20 patients treated second-line. The most prevalent grade 3/4 toxicities were haematological, including neutropenia in 54% and thrombocytopenia in 51% of patients. With a median follow-up of 4.5 years from GEM-P initiation, 5-year progression-free survival was 46% (95% CI, 30-62%), and 5-year overall survival was 59% (95% CI, 43-74%). Fourteen of the 41 patients proceeded directly to autologous transplant. Consequently, GEM-P represents an effective salvage chemotherapy, characterized by substantial response rates, facilitating successful transplantation in suitable patients with relapsed or refractory HL.",0,1,0,1
"Efficacy of GEM-P Chemotherapy in the Management of Relapsed Hodgkin Lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is known for its sensitivity to chemotherapy. However, patients who experience disease relapse typically undergo high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, a strategy dependent on effective salvage chemotherapy to achieve adequate disease control. Currently employed regimens frequently necessitate inpatient administration and are challenging to deliver due to associated toxicities. Gemcitabine and cisplatin possess demonstrated activity in HL, exhibit non-overlapping toxicity profiles with initial chemotherapeutics, and are suitable for outpatient administration. This retrospective single-centre analysis investigated patients with relapsed or refractory HL who received the GEM-P regimen, comprising gemcitabine 1,000 mg/m² on D1, D8, and D15; methylprednisolone 1,000 mg on D1-5; and cisplatin 100 mg/m² on D15, administered every 28 days. Data on demographics, survival, response, and toxicity were collected from 41 eligible patients with a median age of 27 years. A total of 122 GEM-P cycles were administered (median 3 cycles; range 1-6). Twenty out of 41 patients (48%) received GEM-P as second-line treatment, while 11/41 (27%) received it as third-line therapy.

Papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis is a rare, benign lesion that can manifest sporadically or in association with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Prior reports have not included immunohistochemical or molecular genetic analyses of the VHL gene for this condition. We describe two cases of clear cell papillary cystadenoma of the epididymis, both initially misidentified as metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both lesions demonstrated positive immunohistochemical staining for low and intermediate molecular weight keratins (Cam 5.2 and AE1/AE3), EMA, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, while testing negative for CEA.

"Renal Pelvis Invasive Carcinoma Following Cyclophosphamide Treatment for Nonmalignant Disease. A 47-year-old female patient, who had right hydroureteronephrosis due to ureterovesical junction obstruction, developed gross hematuria after five years of cyclophosphamide treatment for cerebral vasculitis. A right nephroureterectomy was performed to control bleeding. The excised specimen revealed clinically occult invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis. While cyclophosphamide is recognized for causing hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic changes mimicking high-grade carcinoma, its link to urinary tract carcinoma is less acknowledged. Previous literature documents twenty cases of urinary bladder carcinoma and one prostate carcinoma associated with its use. This report presents the initial instance of renal pelvis carcinoma associated with cyclophosphamide treatment. It represents the third documented urinary tract malignancy linked to cyclophosphamide therapy for a non-malignant condition. The tumor's association with pre-existing hydroureteronephrosis implies that urinary stasis increased and extended the upper urinary tract epithelium's exposure to cyclophosphamide.

Control of the bleeding necessitated a right nephroureterectomy. Histopathological examination of the specimen identified an incidentally discovered invasive carcinoma of the renal pelvis. Although the propensity of cyclophosphamide to induce hemorrhagic cystitis and urinary cytologic abnormalities that are indistinguishable from high-grade carcinoma is widely known, its association with urinary tract carcinoma receives less attention. Twenty instances of urinary bladder carcinoma and one case of prostate carcinoma have previously been reported in conjunction with its administration. This case constitutes the first report of renal pelvis carcinoma linked to cyclophosphamide therapy. Furthermore, it marks the third documented urinary tract cancer associated with cyclophosphamide treatment for a non-malignant ailment. The concurrent presence of the tumor and pre-existing hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis prolonged and intensified the upper urinary tract epithelium's exposure to cyclophosphamide. Patients slated for long-term cyclophosphamide treatment ought to be routinely screened for obstructive uropathy.",0,1,0,1
"Invasive Renal Pelvis Carcinoma Manifesting Post-Cyclophosphamide Treatment for Non-Malignant Condition. A 47-year-old female patient, experiencing right hydroureteronephrosis from ureterovesical junction obstruction, developed gross hematuria following five years of cyclophosphamide therapy for cerebral vasculitis. A right nephroureterectomy was performed to manage the bleeding. Pathological analysis of the removed tissue revealed a clinically occult invasive renal pelvis carcinoma. While the capacity of cyclophosphamide to cause hemorrhagic cystitis and urinary cytologic findings mimicking high-grade carcinoma is established, its link to urinary tract carcinoma is less commonly recognized. Twenty urinary bladder carcinomas and one prostatic carcinoma have been previously reported in association with its use. This case is the inaugural report of renal pelvis carcinoma connected to cyclophosphamide therapy, and the third urinary tract cancer associated with cyclophosphamide treatment for a nonmalignant disease. The tumor's co-occurrence with pre-existing hydroureteronephrosis suggests that stasis led to prolonged and intensified exposure of the upper urinary tract epithelium to cyclophosphamide. Routine evaluation for obstructive uropathy is recommended for patients who are candidates for long-term cyclophosphamide treatment.",0,1,0,1
"Renal Pelvis Carcinoma, Invasive Type, After Cyclophosphamide Use for Non-Malignant Illness. A 47-year-old woman, presenting with right hydroureteronephrosis due to ureterovesical junction obstruction, experienced gross hematuria after a five-year regimen of cyclophosphamide for cerebral vasculitis. To control the bleeding, a right nephroureterectomy was deemed necessary. The pathology specimen subsequently confirmed a clinically occult invasive carcinoma within the renal pelvis. The association of cyclophosphamide with hemorrhagic cystitis and urine cytologic abnormalities, which are indistinguishable from high-grade carcinoma, is widely acknowledged; however, its connection to urinary tract carcinoma is less broadly understood. Prior reports detail twenty carcinomas of the urinary bladder and one carcinoma of the prostate in relation to cyclophosphamide administration. This particular case represents the first documented renal pelvis carcinoma linked to cyclophosphamide treatment. It also constitutes the third reported urinary tract cancer associated with cyclophosphamide therapy for a non-malignant condition. The concurrent presence of the tumor with pre-existing hydroureteronephrosis implies that stasis prolonged and intensified the upper urinary tract epithelium's exposure to the drug.

"Renal Toxicity Assessment of Select Antineoplastic Agents and Polychemotherapy. An investigation was conducted in Wistar rats to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of specific antineoplastic agents, namely nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cyclophosphamide (CY), administered individually or as a combination (MTX + 5-FU + CY, or CMF). Post-administration measurements included plasma and urine creatinine concentrations, as well as creatinine clearance. Histopathological examination of renal tissue was also performed. Monotherapy with MTX resulted in a statistically significant elevation (p = 0.0228) of plasma creatinine levels and a notable decrease (p = 0.0001) in creatinine clearance, compared to control subjects. Conversely, administration of NG, 5-FU, or CY alone did not induce a statistically significant increase in creatinine concentration or clearance when contrasted with the control group. In the polytherapy regimen (CMF), a statistically significant reduction (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was observed, although plasma creatinine concentration did not significantly rise compared to controls. Cyclophosphamide monotherapy led to hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, a complication not observed when CY was combined with 5-FU and MTX. Renal histological alterations were identified after MTX, CY, and NG administration, but not following 5-FU or the combined MTX + 5-FU + CY regimen, relative to controls. These findings suggest that the nephrotoxicity associated with the combined MTX + 5-FU + CY regimen is diminished compared to its components in monotherapy.",0,1,0,1
"Investigation into Renal Impairment Induced by Certain Chemotherapeutic Drugs and Their Combinations. Experiments in Wistar rats were designed to assess the nephrotoxic activity of the anticancer agents nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cyclophosphamide (CY), administered either as single agents or in a combined regimen (MTX + 5-FU + CY, abbreviated as CMF). Following drug delivery, plasma and urinary creatinine levels, alongside creatinine clearance, were quantified. Furthermore, the kidneys underwent histopathological assessment. A significant rise (p = 0.0228) in plasma creatinine concentration and a profound reduction (p = 0.0001) in creatinine clearance were documented after MTX administration when contrasted with control animals. In contrast, NG, 5-FU, and CY given alone did not cause a statistically significant elevation in creatinine concentration or an increase in creatinine clearance compared to the non-cytostatic group. Under the CMF polytherapy protocol, a statistically significant decline (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was detected, though creatinine concentration did not significantly elevate relative to controls. Hemorrhagic cystitis was induced by CY in 40% of rats when administered singly, but this adverse effect was absent when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histological changes were evident in renal tissues of rats treated with MTX, CY, and NG; however, no such changes were observed after 5-FU or the joint MTX + 5-FU + CY treatment, in comparison to controls.

Post-treatment evaluations involved determining plasma and urine creatinine concentrations, as well as creatinine clearance. Renal histopathology was also conducted. A statistically significant increase (p = 0.0228) in plasma creatinine concentration and a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0001) in creatinine clearance were recorded following MTX monotherapy, in comparison to control animals. Conversely, administration of NG, 5-FU, and CY as single agents did not lead to a statistically significant elevation in creatinine concentration or an increase in creatinine clearance relative to the untreated group. With the CMF polytherapy regimen, a statistically significant reduction (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance was identified, but creatinine concentration did not increase significantly compared to controls. Cyclophosphamide alone provoked hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats, a condition that did not manifest when combined with 5-FU and MTX. Histological modifications in rat kidneys were observed after MTX, CY, and NG administration, while 5-FU and the combined MTX + 5-FU + CY treatment showed no such changes compared to controls.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the nephrotoxic effects of the anticancer drugs nitrogranulogen (NG), methotrexate (MTX), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cyclophosphamide (CY), administered either alone or in a combined chemotherapy regimen [MTX + 5-FU + CY (CMF)], using Wistar rats as an experimental model. Following drug administration, plasma and urine creatinine levels, along with creatinine clearance, were measured. Renal histopathological analysis was also performed. Methotrexate administration alone resulted in a significant increase (p = 0.0228) in plasma creatinine concentration and a significant decrease (p = 0.0001) in creatinine clearance when compared to control groups. In contrast, NG, 5-FU, and CY monotherapy did not show a statistically significant rise in creatinine concentration or an increase in creatinine clearance relative to the group not receiving cytostatics. Polytherapy according to the CMF regimen led to a statistically significant decrease (p = 0.0343) in creatinine clearance, although creatinine concentration did not exhibit a significant increase compared to controls. Cyclophosphamide was responsible for hemorrhagic cystitis in 40% of rats when given alone, but this complication was absent in the combined therapy with 5-FU and MTX.

"VHL-Sp1 Interaction and Transcriptional Repression of VEGF Promoter Activity. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene plays a critical role in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) pathogenesis, with VHL mutations found in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs. Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels are observed in RCC and VHL disease-related tumors. This study investigated the VHL gene product's impact on VEGF expression. Transient cotransfection of VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs with a wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) vector in various cell lines, including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC lines, demonstrated that wt-VHL protein dose-dependently inhibited VEGF promoter activity by 5- to 10-fold. Deletion analysis identified a 144-bp GC-rich region within the VEGF promoter essential for VHL-mediated repression, which specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in nuclear extracts. Experiments in Drosophila cells showed that cotransfected VHL suppressed Sp1-mediated activation of the VEGF promoter, but not its basal activity. Coimmunoprecipitation confirmed VHL and Sp1 complex formation, and a direct interaction was established using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein with purified Sp1. Furthermore, endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were reduced in permanent RCC cell lines expressing wt-VHL, and nuclear run-on assays indicated that VHL regulates VEGF at least partially at the transcriptional level. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for VHL-mediated transcriptional repression through direct inhibition of Sp1, suggesting that impaired Sp1 inhibition could contribute to the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC.",0,1,0,1
"Regulation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Promoter Activity by von Hippel-Lindau Tumor Suppressor Protein via Sp1 Interaction. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is fundamentally involved in the development of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with mutations identified in both hereditary von Hippel-Lindau disease and sporadic RCC cases. Recent evidence indicates an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA in tumors associated with RCC and VHL disease. Our investigation focused on the effect of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression. We transiently cotransfected VEGF promoter-luciferase constructs with a wild-type VHL (wt-VHL) vector into several cell lines, including 293 embryonic kidney and RCC cell lines. The wt-VHL protein exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of VEGF promoter activity, achieving a reduction of 5- to 10-fold. A 144-bp GC-rich region within the VEGF promoter, critical for VHL-mediated repression, was identified through deletion analysis; this region specifically binds the transcription factor Sp1 in crude nuclear extracts. In Drosophila cells, cotransfection of VHL specifically repressed Sp1-mediated activation of the VEGF promoter, leaving basal activity unaffected. Our subsequent coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that VHL and Sp1 are components of the same protein complex, and a direct interaction between VHL and Sp1 was confirmed using a glutathione-S-transferase-VHL fusion protein and purified Sp1. Additionally, endogenous VEGF mRNA levels were suppressed in permanent RCC cell lines stably expressing wt-VHL, and nuclear run-on studies suggested that VHL primarily regulates VEGF at the transcriptional level. These observations propose a new mechanism of VHL-mediated transcriptional repression through a direct inhibitory action on Sp1, implying that the loss of Sp1 inhibition may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of von Hippel-Lindau disease and RCC.",0,1,0,1
"Direct Inhibition of Sp1 by VHL Tumor Suppressor Protein Represses VEGF Promoter Activity. The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene plays a pivotal role in the etiology of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), with VHL mutations frequently detected in both von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and sporadic RCCs. Studies have recently indicated increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA levels in RCC and von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumors. We therefore evaluated the impact of the VHL gene product on VEGF expression.

"Sustained Metformin Administration Mitigates Left Ventricular Dysfunction and TLR4 Signaling Post-Myocardial Infarction. Acute metformin treatment offers cardioprotection during myocardial infarction by dampening inflammatory responses, mediated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This study investigated the impact of chronic metformin pre-treatment on cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activity following myocardial infarction, and their link to AMPK. Male Wistar rats (n=6 per group) were randomized into five groups: a normal control group and groups receiving isoproterenol after 14 days of twice-daily pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg metformin. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by subcutaneous isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) on days 13 and 14. Isoproterenol alone caused reductions in left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility, as indicated by LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. Notably, left ventricular dysfunction was significantly attenuated in the 25 and 50 mg/kg metformin-treated groups. Metformin considerably lowered isoproterenol-induced increases in cardiac TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels. Similar reductions were observed in serum TNF-α and IL-6. Importantly, the 25 and 50 mg/kg doses proved more effective than 100 mg/kg. Myocardial phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) was substantially elevated by 25 mg/kg metformin, slightly by 50 mg/kg, but not by 100 mg/kg. In conclusion, chronic metformin pre-treatment reduces cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction and suppresses inflammatory responses, likely through the inhibition of TLR4 activities. This mechanism presents a potential therapeutic target for protecting infarcted myocardium.",1,0,0,1
"Metformin's Chronic Cardioprotective Effects Post-Myocardial Infarction via TLR4 Signaling Inhibition. The protective effects of acute metformin treatment in myocardial infarction are attributed to its suppression of inflammation through AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the long-term effects of metformin pre-treatment on cardiac function and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation following myocardial infarction, alongside its relationship with AMPK. Male Wistar rats (n=6 per group) were allocated to five experimental groups: a normal control, and groups receiving isoproterenol after a 14-day chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg metformin administered twice daily. Isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously on days 13 and 14 to induce acute myocardial infarction. Isoproterenol administration alone resulted in diminished left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility, quantified by LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. A significant reduction in left ventricular dysfunction was observed in the groups treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg of metformin. Metformin markedly reduced the isoproterenol-induced increases in cardiac levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Corresponding decreases were also evident in serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels. Notably, the 25 and 50 mg/kg doses demonstrated superior efficacy compared to 100 mg/kg. Myocardial phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) levels were significantly elevated by 25 mg/kg metformin, moderately by 50 mg/kg, but not by 100 mg/kg. Therefore, chronic metformin pre-treatment reduces cardiac impairment post-myocardial infarction and suppresses inflammatory responses, potentially through the suppression of TLR4 activities. This identified mechanism may serve as a therapeutic target for myocardial protection after infarction.",1,0,0,1
"Chronic Metformin Pre-treatment: A Strategy to Attenuate Post-Infarction Left Ventricular Dysfunction and TLR4 Pathway Activation. While acute metformin treatment is known for its cardioprotective effects in myocardial infarction, primarily by suppressing inflammation via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation, this study aimed to determine if chronic metformin pre-treatment could mitigate cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activities following myocardial infarction, and explore the involvement of AMPK. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups (n=6 each): a normal control group and groups that received isoproterenol after a 14-day, twice-daily chronic pre-treatment with metformin at doses of 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by injecting isoproterenol (100 mg/kg subcutaneously) on the 13th and 14th days. Isoproterenol alone led to a decrease in left ventricular systolic pressure and myocardial contractility, as measured by LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. The extent of left ventricular dysfunction was notably reduced in the groups receiving 25 and 50 mg/kg of metformin. Metformin significantly lowered the isoproterenol-induced increases in cardiac levels of TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). Similar reductions were observed in serum TNF-α and IL-6 concentrations. Interestingly, the lower doses (25 and 50 mg/kg) were more efficacious than the 100 mg/kg dose. Phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) in the myocardium was markedly elevated by 25 mg/kg metformin, modestly by 50 mg/kg, but not by 100 mg/kg. Consequently, chronic metformin pre-treatment lessens post-myocardial infarction cardiac dysfunction and suppresses inflammatory responses, potentially through the inhibition of TLR4 pathway activities. This mechanism offers a promising target for protecting the myocardium after infarction.",1,0,0,1
"Inhibition of TLR4 Signaling and Alleviation of Left Ventricular Dysfunction by Chronic Metformin After Myocardial Infarction. Acute metformin administration confers myocardial protection by suppressing inflammatory responses, a process linked to AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. The current investigation sought to delineate how chronic metformin pre-treatment influences cardiac dysfunction and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activity following myocardial infarction, and its connection to AMPK. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to one of five groups (n=6): a normal control, and groups exposed to isoproterenol after chronic pre-treatment with 0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/kg metformin twice daily for two weeks. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (100 mg/kg) on the 13th and 14th days. Isoproterenol alone resulted in decreased left ventricular systolic pressure and compromised myocardial contractility, as evidenced by LVdp/dtmax and LVdp/dtmin. Critically, left ventricular dysfunction was significantly ameliorated in the groups administered 25 and 50 mg/kg of metformin. Metformin substantially mitigated the isoproterenol-induced elevation of cardiac TLR4 mRNA, myeloid differentiation protein 88 (MyD88), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels. Comparable reductions were also observed in serum TNF-α and IL-6 levels. However, the lower doses of 25 and 50 mg/kg exhibited greater effectiveness than the 100 mg/kg dose. Myocardial phosphorylated AMPKa (p-AMPK) was significantly augmented by 25 mg/kg metformin, marginally by 50 mg/kg, but not by 100 mg/kg.

"In Vivo Cardioprotective Effect of p300 Expression Against Apoptosis. Doxorubicin, an antineoplastic agent, is known to suppress cardiac-specific gene expression and trigger myocardial cell apoptosis. It also causes depletion of cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator vital for maintaining the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. The precise involvement of p300 in mitigating doxorubicin-induced apoptosis remained to be elucidated. To investigate this, transgenic mice with cardiac p300 overexpression and wild-type counterparts were administered doxorubicin. Compared to wild-type controls, the transgenic mice exhibited an elevated survival rate, along with better-preserved left ventricular function and cardiac alpha-sarcomeric actin expression. Myocardial cell apoptosis, induced by doxorubicin in wild-type mice, was absent in the transgenic cohort. Furthermore, p300 expression led to increased cardiac levels of bcl-2 and mdm-2, without affecting p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family. These findings conclusively demonstrate that the overexpression of p300 confers protection to cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and diminishes the severity of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.",1,0,0,1
"p300 Expression: A Shield Against Cardiac Myocyte Apoptosis In Vivo. The antitumor drug doxorubicin is recognized for its ability to downregulate cardiac-specific gene expression and provoke myocardial cell apoptosis. This drug also depletes cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator essential for maintaining the differentiated state of cardiac myocytes. However, the exact role of p300 in providing protection against doxorubicin-provoked apoptosis has not been established. To address this, transgenic mice engineered to overexpress p300 in the heart, alongside wild-type mice, underwent doxorubicin treatment. Relative to their wild-type littermates, transgenic mice displayed a higher survival rate, coupled with more intact left ventricular function and sustained cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. While doxorubicin instigated myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice, this effect was not observed in the transgenic animals. The presence of p300 correlated with elevated cardiac levels of bcl-2 and mdm-2, but not p53 or other bcl-2 family members. These results indicate that elevated p300 expression safeguards cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and reduces the extent of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.",1,0,0,1
"Mitigation of Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiac Apoptosis by p300 Overexpression In Vivo. Doxorubicin, an effective antineoplastic agent, is known to repress gene expression specific to the heart and to trigger apoptosis in myocardial cells. Furthermore, doxorubicin causes a reduction in cardiac p300, a transcriptional coactivator crucial for preserving the differentiated phenotype of cardiac myocytes. The potential protective function of p300 against doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, however, remained unclear. To elucidate this, transgenic mice genetically modified to overexpress p300 in their hearts, along with their wild-type counterparts, received doxorubicin therapy. A comparison revealed that transgenic mice exhibited a superior survival rate, in addition to better preservation of left ventricular function and cardiac alpha-sarcomeric actin expression, when contrasted with wild-type mice. Doxorubicin elicited myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice, a phenomenon absent in the transgenic group. Cardiac p300 expression was associated with an increase in bcl-2 and mdm-2 levels, though no change was noted for p53 or other bcl-2 family components. These findings confirm that increased p300 expression effectively protects cardiac myocytes from doxorubicin-mediated apoptosis and lessens the severity of acute heart failure in adult mice in vivo.",1,0,0,1
"p300 Expression Confers Cardioprotection Against Apoptosis In Vivo. Doxorubicin, an antineoplastic agent, is known to suppress the expression of cardiac-specific genes and to induce apoptosis in myocardial cells.

Relative to wild-type animals, transgenic mice demonstrated an enhanced survival rate, coupled with more intact left ventricular function and maintained cardiac expression of alpha-sarcomeric actin. Doxorubicin successfully induced myocardial cell apoptosis in wild-type mice but not in the transgenic mice. The expression of p300 resulted in elevated cardiac concentrations of bcl-2 and mdm-2, without influencing p53 or other members of the bcl-2 family.

"Hydroxytyrosol's Efficacy Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity in Breast Cancer Rats: Attenuation of Oxidative Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction. Oxidative stress contributes to various pathologies, including cancer, aging, and cardiovascular disease, and can enhance the therapeutic action of drugs like doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is known to induce considerable cardiotoxicity, characterized by elevated oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function. This study investigated whether the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol could mitigate doxorubicin-associated chronic cardiac toxicity in breast cancer-bearing rats. Thirty-six rats with chemically induced breast tumors were divided into four experimental groups: control, hydroxytyrosol (0.5 mg/kg, 5 days/week), doxorubicin (1 mg/kg/week), and a combination of doxorubicin and hydroxytyrosol. We analyzed cardiac cellular and mitochondrial disturbances, mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV, apoptosis-inducing factor, and markers of oxidative stress. Hydroxytyrosol significantly ameliorated the cardiac disturbances exacerbated by doxorubicin, manifesting as a reduction in the percentage of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage. These findings suggest that hydroxytyrosol enhances the mitochondrial electron transport chain.

Oxidative stress plays a role in numerous physiological processes, including carcinogenesis, aging, and cardiovascular ailments, and has been shown to potentiate the therapeutic effects of agents such as doxorubicin. Doxorubicin elicits substantial cardiotoxicity, identified by significant increases in oxidative stress and compromised mitochondrial function. Our investigation sought to determine if the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol could alleviate doxorubicin-induced chronic cardiac toxicity in rats afflicted with breast cancer. Thirty-six rats with chemically-induced breast tumors were allocated into four distinct groups: a control group, a hydroxytyrosol-treated group (0.5 mg/kg, 5 days/week), a doxorubicin-treated group (1 mg/kg/week), and a group receiving both doxorubicin and hydroxytyrosol. We assessed cardiac cellular and mitochondrial disruptions, the activity of mitochondrial electron transport chain complexes I-IV, apoptosis-inducing factor, and oxidative stress indicators. Hydroxytyrosol intervention notably improved the cardiac impairments exacerbated by doxorubicin, achieving a significant reduction in the proportion of altered mitochondria and oxidative damage.

"A Comprehensive Assessment of Serological, Pathological, and Functional Manifestations in Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiotoxicity. While many effective cancer treatments induce significant cardiac morbidity, reliable biomarkers or functional indicators of early damage, critical for timely monitoring and intervention, remain elusive. This investigation employed a rat model of escalating doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy, utilizing diverse methodologies, including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to provide the most detailed time-course characterization to date of the serological, pathological, and functional events underpinning this toxicity. Hannover Wistar rats received 1.25 mg/kg DOX weekly for eight weeks, followed by a four-week ""recovery"" period without dosing.

"A Prospective Investigation of Cardiac Monitoring during Fluorouracil Therapy. Cardiac toxicity linked to fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy has been noted anecdotally but lacks systematic examination. We conducted a prospective study utilizing continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring in 25 patients receiving 5-FU infusion for solid tumor treatment to determine the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients underwent monitoring for 23 ± 4 hours pre-infusion and 98 ± 9 hours during 5-FU administration. Anginal episodes were infrequent, with only one patient experiencing angina during infusion. However, asymptomatic ST changes (defined as ≥1 mm ST deviation) were prevalent: 6 of 25 patients (24%) exhibited ST changes before 5-FU infusion, compared to 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P < .002). The rate of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 ± 0.02 prior to 5-FU versus 0.13 ± 0.03 during 5-FU (P < .001); the duration of ECG alterations was 0.6 ± 0.3 minutes per patient per hour pre-5-FU compared to 1.9 ± 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P < .01). ECG changes were more common in individuals with documented coronary artery disease. Two sudden deaths were recorded, both occurring at the completion of the chemotherapy course. Our findings indicate that 5-FU infusion is associated with a notable increase in silent ST segment deviation, suggestive of ischemia, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease.

Conversely, asymptomatic ST changes (defined as ≥1 mm ST deviation) were frequent: 6 out of 25 patients (24%) showed ST changes prior to 5-FU infusion, escalating to 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P < .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour increased from 0.05 ± 0.02 before 5-FU to 0.13 ± 0.03 during 5-FU (P < .001); the mean duration of ECG changes per patient per hour rose from 0.6 ± 0.3 minutes before 5-FU to 1.9 ± 0.5 minutes during 5-FU (P < .01). Patients with established coronary artery disease exhibited ECG changes more frequently. Two instances of sudden death occurred, both towards the end of the chemotherapy regimen. We conclude that 5-FU infusion correlates with a significant rise in silent ST segment deviation indicative of ischemia, especially in patients with coronary artery disease. The mechanism and clinical implications of these ECG observations require further elucidation.",1,0,0,1
"Prospective Assessment of ST Segment Changes with Ambulatory ECG during Fluorouracil Treatment. Cardiac toxicity linked to fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment has been anecdotally reported but not systematically evaluated. We prospectively conducted continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring on 25 patients receiving 5-FU infusion for solid tumors to assess the incidence of ischemic ST changes. Patients were monitored for an average of 23 ± 4 hours before 5-FU infusion and 98 ± 9 hours during the infusion. Anginal episodes were uncommon, with only one patient experiencing angina during 5-FU infusion. However, asymptomatic ST changes (defined as ≥1 mm ST deviation) were frequently observed: 6 of 25 patients (24%) exhibited ST changes before 5-FU infusion, compared to 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P < .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 ± 0.02 pre-5-FU infusion versus 0.13 ± 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P < .001); the duration of ECG changes was 0.6 ± 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5-FU versus 1.9 ± 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5-FU (P < .01). ECG changes were more pronounced in patients with diagnosed coronary artery disease. Two cases of sudden death occurred, both at the completion of their chemotherapy course. Our conclusion is that 5-FU infusion significantly increases silent ST segment deviation, indicative of ischemia, particularly among individuals with coronary artery disease. The exact mechanism and clinical significance of these observed ECG alterations are yet to be determined.",1,0,0,1
"Cardiovascular Effects of Fluorouracil Therapy: A Prospective Ambulatory ECG Study. Reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy are largely anecdotal, lacking systematic investigation. To address this, we prospectively employed continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring in 25 patients undergoing 5-FU infusion for solid tumor treatment, aiming to ascertain the incidence of ischemic ST segment changes. Monitoring extended for 23 ± 4 hours preceding 5-FU infusion and 98 ± 9 hours throughout 5-FU administration. Anginal episodes proved rare, with only a single patient reporting angina during 5-FU infusion. In contrast, asymptomatic ST changes (defined as ≥1 mm ST deviation) were common: 6 of 25 patients (24%) showed ST changes before 5-FU infusion, increasing to 17 (68%) during 5-FU infusion (P < .002). The incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 ± 0.02 prior to 5-FU infusion compared to 0.13 ± 0.03 during 5-FU infusion (P < .001); the average duration of ECG changes per patient per hour was 0.6 ± 0.3 minutes before 5-FU versus 1.9 ± 0.5 minutes during 5-FU (P < .01). ECG abnormalities were observed more frequently in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease. There were two occurrences of sudden death, both at the conclusion of the chemotherapy course. We conclude that 5-FU infusion is significantly linked to an elevation in silent ST segment deviation suggestive of ischemia, particularly in patients with coronary artery disease. The specific mechanism and clinical relevance of these ECG findings necessitate further study.",1,0,0,1

"The Effect of Administration Timing on monoHER's Cardioprotection Against Doxorubicin-Induced Toxicity in Mice. Doxorubicin (DOX), an effective yet cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic, causes cardiac damage primarily through free radical formation, particularly affecting cardiac myocytes due to their limited antioxidant defenses. Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER), a semisynthetic flavonoid, has demonstrated cardioprotective properties against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity by scavenging radicals and chelating iron. Given monoHER's relatively short terminal half-life (approximately 30 min), the interval between its administration and DOX delivery was hypothesized to influence its protective efficacy. This study aimed to investigate this relationship. Six groups, each comprising 6 BALB/c mice, received either saline, DOX alone, or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) preceded by monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) at intervals of 10, 30, 60, or 120 min. Following a 6-week treatment and a 2-week observation period, mice were euthanized. Cardiac tissues underwent light microscopy to assess cardiomyocyte damage using the Billingham method (1978). Microscopic analysis revealed that DOX alone significantly increased cardiac damage compared to the saline control group (P<0.001). Specifically, the count of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold higher (95% CI 4.4-21.0) in DOX-treated mice than in controls. When monoHER preceded DOX, the ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes relative to saline-treated mice ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). Overall, monoHER administration before DOX resulted in a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) in abnormal cardiomyocytes. Importantly, this cardioprotective effect was independent of the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345). These findings suggest that monoHER can be administered shortly before DOX in a clinical outpatient setting.",1,0,0,1
"Interval Dependence of Monohydroxyethylrutoside's Cardioprotective Efficacy Against Doxorubicin-Induced Damage in Mice. Despite its acknowledged cardiotoxic profile, the anthracycline doxorubicin (DOX) remains a vital and extensively employed chemotherapeutic agent. DOX-induced cardiac impairment is presumed to stem from free radical generation, with reactive oxygen species particularly impacting cardiac myocytes due to their apparently limited antioxidant defense mechanisms. Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER), a semisynthetic flavonoid, has exhibited cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity via its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Given monoHER's relatively brief final half-life (approximately 30 minutes), the time separation between monoHER and DOX administrations was hypothesized to modulate its protective action. Therefore, this investigation sought to determine this potential influence. Six groups, each comprising 6 BALB/c mice, were administered either saline, DOX solely, or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) following monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) at intervals of 10, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. After a 6-week treatment regimen and an additional 2-week observation period, the mice were humanely sacrificed. Their cardiac tissues underwent processing for light microscopy, followed by an assessment of cardiomyocyte damage according to Billingham (1978). Microscopic assessment confirmed that treatment with DOX alone caused significant cardiac injury when contrasted with the saline control group (P<0.001). The quantity of damaged cardiomyocytes was found to be 9.6-fold greater (95% CI 4.4-21.0) in mice receiving only DOX compared to control animals. The proportion of abnormal cardiomyocytes in mice treated with monoHER prior to DOX, relative to those given saline, spanned from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The average protective effect achieved by administering monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) in aberrant cardiomyocytes. Crucially, this protective efficacy showed no dependency on the time interval separating monoHER and DOX administration (P=0.345). These findings suggest that monoHER could be administered shortly preceding DOX in an outpatient clinical context.",1,0,0,1
"Assessing the Impact of Pre-Doxorubicin monoHER Administration Timing on Cardioprotection in Murine Models. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline, is a widely used and effective chemotherapeutic, yet its significant cardiotoxicity is well-documented. This DOX-induced cardiac damage is thought to arise from the generation of free radicals, with reactive oxygen species particularly harming cardiac myocytes due to their inherently deficient antioxidant defense system. Monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER), a semisynthetic flavonoid, has demonstrated effective cardioprotection against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its dual actions of radical scavenging and iron chelation. Considering monoHER's relatively brief final half-life (approximately 30 minutes), it was posited that the time gap between monoHER and DOX dosing might influence monoHER's cardioprotective efficacy. This study was thus designed to explore this potential relationship. The methodology involved six groups, each consisting of 6 BALB/c mice, which were treated with either saline, DOX exclusively, or DOX (4 mg/kg i.v.) after monoHER (500 mg/kg i.p.) at intervals of 10, 30, 60, or 120 minutes. Following a 6-week treatment period and an additional 2-week observation phase, the mice were humanely euthanized. Their cardiac tissues were prepared for light microscopy, enabling the quantification of cardiomyocyte damage according to the Billingham criteria (1978). Microscopic assessment established that DOX treatment alone resulted in substantial cardiac damage compared to the saline control group (P<0.001). Specifically, the number of compromised cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold greater (95% CI 4.4-21.0) in mice receiving only DOX than in control animals. For mice receiving monoHER prior to DOX, the proportion of anomalous cardiomyocytes, relative to those treated with saline, varied from 1.6 to 2.8 (mean 2.2, 95% CI 1.2-4.1, P=0.019). The average protective effect observed with monoHER prior to DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold decrease (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) in abnormal cardiomyocytes. Crucially, this protective benefit exhibited no dependence on the duration of the interval between monoHER and DOX administrations (P=0.345). These results suggest that in an outpatient clinical context, monoHER can be administered immediately preceding DOX.",1,0,0,1
"Time Interval's Role in monoHER-Mediated Cardioprotection Against Doxorubicin Toxicity in Mice. Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline, remains a highly effective and widely utilized chemotherapeutic despite its known cardiotoxicity. DOX-induced cardiac injury is primarily attributed to free radical formation, with reactive oxygen species disproportionately affecting cardiac myocytes due to their comparatively poor antioxidant defense system. The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside (monoHER) has demonstrated cardioprotective efficacy against DOX-induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties. Considering monoHER's relatively short final half-life (approximately 30 min), investigators hypothesized that the time gap between monoHER and DOX administration could influence its cardioprotective effect.

The introduction of monoHER before DOX resulted in a significant mean protective effect, manifesting as a 4.4-fold reduction (P<0.001, 95% CI 2.3-8.2) in abnormal cardiomyocytes.

The WT1 gene, a candidate Wilms tumor gene situated in the 11p13 chromosomal region, was recently isolated. We conducted DNA sequence analysis on constitutional cells from eight patients, identifying heterozygous mutations in six individuals. Four of these mutations were located in exon 9, all being missense alterations. Specifically, three occurred at nucleotide position 1180, resulting in an arginine to tryptophan amino acid substitution, while the other was at position 1186, converting aspartic acid to asparagine in the predicted protein. One patient presented with a missense mutation in exon 8, changing arginine to histidine. In the final patient, a single base pair insertion at nucleotide position 821 within exon 6 led to the formation of a premature stop codon. Despite comprehensive genomic sequencing of the gene, no mutation was detected in one patient. The remaining patient exhibited a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region, with no further mutations identified. No clear correlation was observed between the mutation type and the clinical phenotype. These findings further underscore the critical role of the WT1 gene in both renal and genitourinary system development.",0,1,1,1
"Identification of constitutional WT1 gene mutations in individuals with Denys-Drash syndrome. Patients afflicted with Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) display a characteristic nephropathy, alongside genital abnormalities, and are predisposed to developing Wilms tumor. Ultimately, these patients progress to end-stage renal failure. The WT1 gene, located within the 11p13 chromosomal region and identified as a candidate Wilms tumor gene, has been recently cloned. Our analysis of DNA sequences from constitutional cells of eight patients revealed heterozygous mutations in six cases. Among these, four mutations were found in exon 9, all manifesting as missense changes. Three specific mutations at nucleotide position 1180 resulted in an Arg > Trp amino acid change, while another at position 1186 caused an Asp > Asn conversion in the resultant protein. One patient had a missense mutation in exon 8, which converted an arginine to a histidine. An insertion of a single base pair at nucleotide position 821 in exon 6 generated a premature stop codon in the last patient studied. In one patient, no mutation was discoverable despite exhaustive genomic sequencing of the gene. The final patient had a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region, and no additional mutations were detected. A direct correlation between the specific mutation type and the phenotypic expression was not apparent. This research further supports the significance of the WT1 gene in the development of both the kidney and the genito-urinary system.",0,1,1,1
"Genetic basis of Denys-Drash syndrome: Constitutional WT1 gene alterations. Denys-Drash syndrome, marked by a distinct nephropathy, genital anomalies, and a heightened risk of Wilms tumor, inevitably culminates in end-stage renal failure for affected individuals. The WT1 gene, located at 11p13 and recognized as a potential Wilms tumor gene, has recently been isolated. We examined the DNA sequence in constitutional cells from eight patients and successfully identified heterozygous mutations in six of them. Four of these mutations resided in exon 9, all being missense alterations. Three distinct mutations occurred at nucleotide position 1180, leading to an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution, while another at position 1186 resulted in an aspartic acid-to-asparagine conversion in the predicted protein. Additionally, one patient displayed a missense mutation in exon 8, altering arginine to histidine. The final patient presented with a single base pair insertion at nucleotide 821 in exon 6, which produced a premature stop codon. No mutation could be found in one patient, even after complete genomic sequencing of the gene. The eighth patient exhibited a constitutional deletion of the 11p13 region, and no further mutations were present.

"Underlying Molecular Mechanism of Chromosome 22q11 Rearrangement Disorders. The 22q11 chromosomal region is vulnerable to rearrangements implicated in congenital anomaly disorders and malignant tumors. Specific congenital conditions, namely cat-eye syndrome, der(22) syndrome, and velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS), are linked to tetrasomy, trisomy, or monosomy, respectively, of a segment of 22q11. VCFS/DGS represents the most prevalent syndrome associated with 22q11 rearrangements. To ascertain whether particular 22q11 regions exhibit rearrangement susceptibility, deletion endpoints were precisely mapped in numerous VCFS/DGS patients via haplotype analysis. A 3 Mb deletion is observed in the majority of VCFS/DGS patients, while some exhibit a nested distal deletion breakpoint resulting in a 1.5 Mb deletion, and a small number of patients possess distinct deletions or translocations. The significant population prevalence and largely sporadic nature of these cases imply that sequences at or near breakpoints confer a predisposition to chromosomal rearrangements. Investigating this, we developed hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients encompassing all three deletion categories. Our findings demonstrate that these breakpoints consistently lie within similar low copy repeats, designated LCR22s. Further reinforcing this concept, we identified a family presenting with an interstitial duplication of the identical 3 Mb region commonly deleted in VCFS/DGS patients. We propose models illustrating how LCR22s can facilitate diverse homologous recombination events, thereby producing the array of rearrangements associated with congenital anomaly disorders.

The 22q11 chromosomal region is predisposed to rearrangements connected with congenital malformation syndromes and oncological conditions. Tetrasomy, trisomy, or monosomy of a portion of 22q11 are, respectively, linked to three congenital anomaly disorders: cat-eye syndrome, der(22) syndrome, and velo-cardio-facial syndrome/DiGeorge syndrome (VCFS/DGS). VCFS/DGS is the most frequently occurring syndrome involving 22q11 rearrangements. To determine specific regions within 22q11 prone to rearrangements, haplotype analysis was employed to define deletion endpoints in a substantial cohort of VCFS/DGS patients. The predominant observation in VCFS/DGS patients is a 3 Mb deletion, with some exhibiting a nested distal deletion breakpoint leading to a 1.5 Mb deletion, and rare individuals presenting unique deletions or translocations.

To explore this, we generated hamster-human somatic hybrid cell lines from VCFS/DGS patients representing all three classes of deletions.

"The utility of brain natriuretic peptide in predicting anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Anthracyclines, despite their efficacy as antineoplastic agents, frequently induce dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. This necessitates the identification of highly sensitive methods for predicting cardiac dysfunction. Our investigation aimed to ascertain if plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels could serve as a straightforward diagnostic marker for cardiotoxicity resulting from anthracycline treatment in acute leukemia patients receiving a daunorubicin (DNR)-containing regimen. Thirteen patients diagnosed with acute leukemia underwent a DNR-containing treatment. Radionuclide angiography was employed to assess cardiac functions prior to chemotherapy. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and BNP were quantified concurrently with the radionuclide angiography. Following chemotherapy completion, three patients experienced congestive heart failure, and five others were diagnosed with subclinical heart failure. In all patients who developed either clinical or subclinical heart failure, plasma BNP levels rose above the normal threshold of 40 pg/ml before heart failure was detectable via radionuclide angiography. Conversely, BNP levels did not increase in patients who did not develop heart failure, even when administered DNR doses exceeding 700 mg/m². Atrial natriuretic peptide levels did not consistently rise in all patients presenting with clinical and subclinical heart failure. These preliminary findings suggest that BNP may function as an early and sensitive indicator of cardiotoxicity induced by anthracyclines.",1,0,1,1
"Predictive significance of brain natriuretic peptide for anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Anthracycline agents are potent antineoplastic drugs, yet they commonly provoke dose-related cardiotoxicity.

"A novel case of sorafenib-associated acute myocardial infarction stemming from coronary artery spasm. A 65-year-old male with advanced renal cell carcinoma presented with persistent resting chest pain, two weeks after initiating sorafenib. He was diagnosed with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction via laboratory results and electrocardiogram, further supported by subendocardial infarction on enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Despite no angiographic evidence of coronary artery stenosis, a provocative test confirmed coronary artery spasm. Discontinuation of sorafenib, along with calcium-channel blocker and nitrate administration, alleviated his symptoms, though a recurrence ensued upon restarting sorafenib. Subsequent incorporation of oral nicorandil mitigated symptoms and maintained stable angina. This represents the initial report of sorafenib-induced coronary artery spasm.

Amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic medication for life-threatening tachycardia, is associated with diverse adverse effects. This report details an autopsy case of a patient with valvular heart disease who developed a 1.5 cm diameter lung mass and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) following prolonged amiodarone therapy. Radiologically, the lung mass was strongly suggestive of lung cancer on CT and positron emission tomography; however, histological examination revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates within alveolar walls and intra-alveolar foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, consistent with an amiodarone-related lesion. Furthermore, the lung tissue exhibited uneven hemosiderin deposition, and abnormally tortuous capillaries were observed within the mass and in heavily hemosiderotic areas outside it. Renal findings included glomerular membrane spikes, significant podocyte swelling, and subepithelial deposits, some of which were large and hump-like. No evidence of autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms, or other conditions known to cause membranous glomerulonephritis was found.

We present an autopsy case involving a patient with valvular heart disease who developed a 1.5 cm pulmonary mass and proteinuria (2.76 g/day) after extended amiodarone administration. Initial imaging via CT and PET strongly suggested lung cancer; however, histology demonstrated lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages with characteristic myelinoid bodies, thereby identifying the lesion as amiodarone-related. Additionally, the lung tissue showed heterogeneous hemosiderin accumulation, with unusually tortuous capillaries present within the mass and in hyperpigmented lung regions beyond it. Renal biopsy revealed glomerular membrane spikes, pronounced podocyte swelling, and subepithelial deposits, some large and hump-shaped. Common causes of membranous glomerulonephritis, such as autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, or malignancies, were absent. This case emphasizes the potential for significant radiological ambiguity between amiodarone-induced pulmonary lesions and malignancy, and proposes that membranous glomerulonephritis could be a further complication of amiodarone therapy.",1,1,1,1
"Atypical Amiodarone-Associated Pulmonary Mass and Unique Membranous Glomerulonephritis in a Valvular Heart Disease Patient: Diagnostic Complexity and Emerging Manifestations. Amiodarone, an anti-arrhythmic drug for severe tachycardia, is associated with a wide range of reported adverse effects. This report describes an autopsy case of a patient with valvular heart disease who developed a 1.5 cm diameter lung mass and proteinuria measuring 2.76 g/day following long-term amiodarone treatment. While CT and positron emission tomography highly suggested lung cancer, histological analysis confirmed the lesion was amiodarone-related, characterized by lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates within alveolar walls and intra-alveolar foamy macrophages containing distinctive myelinoid bodies. The lung tissue also exhibited patchy hemosiderin deposition and abnormally tortuous capillaries within the mass and in areas of intense hemosiderosis outside it. Kidney examination revealed glomeruli with membrane spikes, significant podocyte edema, and subepithelial deposits, some of which were large and hump-like. Crucially, no underlying autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms, or other known etiologies of membranous glomerulonephritis were identified. This case highlights the considerable diagnostic challenge radiologically in distinguishing amiodarone-related pulmonary lesions from neoplastic processes, and introduces membranous glomerulonephritis as a potentially newly recognized complication of amiodarone therapy.",1,1,1,1
"Amiodarone-Induced Pulmonary Mass and Distinctive Membranous Glomerulonephritis in Valvular Heart Disease: Pathological Insights and Clinical Relevance. Amiodarone, an effective anti-arrhythmic for life-threatening tachyarrhythmias, is known for its diverse adverse effect profile. Presented is an autopsy case of a patient with valvular heart disease who developed a 1.5 cm lung mass and 2.76 g/day proteinuria following chronic amiodarone administration. The lung mass appeared highly suspicious for malignancy on CT and PET scans; however, histopathological examination revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in the alveolar walls and intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages containing characteristic myelinoid bodies, thereby confirming an amiodarone-related etiology. Additionally, the pulmonary parenchyma displayed uneven hemosiderin deposits, and unusually tortuous capillaries were evident both within the mass and in adjacent heavily hemosiderotic lung regions. Renal evaluation identified glomeruli with membrane spikes, marked podocyte swelling, and subepithelial deposits, occasionally large and hump-like. Important negative findings included the absence of autoimmune diseases, viral hepatitis, malignant neoplasms, or other established causes of membranous glomerulonephritis. This case report underscores the profound radiological difficulty in distinguishing amiodarone-related pulmonary lesions from neoplastic processes and posits that membranous glomerulonephritis may represent a previously undescribed complication of amiodarone therapy.",1,1,1,1
"P53 Inhibition's Dual Impact on Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity: Acute Cardioprotection and Delayed Exacerbation. This study investigated the influence of p53 inhibition on both acute and late-stage cardiotoxicity induced by doxorubicin (DOX), a potent anti-cancer agent associated with cardiac damage, particularly in children. Juvenile MHC-CB7 mice, expressing dominant-interfering p53 in cardiomyocytes, and non-transgenic littermates received a cumulative dose of 25 mg/kg DOX over 5 weeks. At 1 week post-treatment (acute phase), MHC-CB7 mice displayed improved cardiac function and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis compared to controls. However, by 13 weeks post-treatment (late phase), a progressive decline in cardiac function and elevated rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis were observed in MHC-CB7 mice relative to non-transgenic counterparts. Mechanistically, p53 inhibition in MHC-CB7 mice prevented transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation, which correlated with increased expression of DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Furthermore, mice with cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deletion exhibited worsened cardiac function, heightened cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and greater Ku70 and Ku80 induction during the acute stage following DOX administration. These findings propose a model where a p53-dependent, STAT3-mediated cardioprotective pathway alleviates DOX-induced myocardial stress during active drug treatment. Consequently, p53 inhibition may confer cardioprotection during drug delivery but paradoxically amplify cardiotoxicity considerably after treatment cessation.",1,1,1,1
"Differential Temporal Effects of P53 Inhibition on Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiac Dysfunction. Doxorubicin (DOX), an effective oncological therapy, carries a significant risk of cardiotoxicity, both acutely and in the long term, with pediatric patients being particularly vulnerable. This investigation assessed how inhibiting p53 influenced the acute versus late-stage manifestations of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity within a juvenile animal model. Two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice, engineered to express dominant-interfering p53 within their cardiomyocytes, alongside non-transgenic littermates, were administered DOX weekly for a total of 5 weeks, achieving a 25 mg/kg cumulative dose. In the acute phase, occurring one week subsequent to the final DOX dose, MHC-CB7 mice exhibited superior cardiac performance and reduced incidence of cardiomyocyte apoptosis compared to non-transgenic controls. Conversely, during the late phase, observed 13 weeks after the last DOX administration, MHC-CB7 mice demonstrated a progressive deterioration in cardiac function and elevated cardiomyocyte apoptosis rates relative to non-transgenic mice. P53 inhibition was found to abrogate the transient STAT3 activation triggered by DOX in MHC-CB7 mice, a phenomenon associated with an augmented induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Additionally, genetically modified mice with a cardiomyocyte-restricted deletion of STAT3 displayed inferior cardiac function, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and higher levels of Ku70 and Ku80 induction in response to acute-stage DOX treatment when compared with their control counterparts. The presented data support a mechanism where a cardioprotective p53-dependent pathway, operating via STAT3 activation, attenuates myocardial stress caused by DOX during its administration. Furthermore, these findings offer an explanation for the observed paradox where p53 inhibition can provide cardiac protection during drug treatment but exacerbate cardiotoxicity well after treatment discontinuation.",1,1,1,1
"P53 Suppression Exacerbates Long-Term Anthracycline Cardiotoxicity. Doxorubicin (DOX) serves as an effective anticancer therapeutic agent, yet its use is complicated by both immediate and delayed cardiotoxicity, a concern particularly pronounced in pediatric populations who are susceptible to DOX-induced heart failure. The current study investigated the differential effects of p53 inhibition on acute versus late-stage doxorubicin cardiotoxicity in a juvenile mouse model. MHC-CB7 mice, 2 weeks of age, expressing a dominant-interfering p53 variant in cardiomyocytes, along with their non-transgenic littermates, received a total of 25 mg/kg DOX administered weekly over 5 weeks. One week after the final DOX treatment, corresponding to the acute stage, MHC-CB7 mice demonstrated enhanced cardiac function and diminished cardiomyocyte apoptosis rates compared to their non-transgenic controls. Unexpectedly, by 13 weeks post-DOX treatment, designated the late stage, MHC-CB7 mice showed a progressive decline in cardiac function and elevated levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when contrasted with non-transgenic mice. Mechanistically, p53 inhibition in MHC-CB7 mice abolished transient DOX-induced STAT3 activation, which was linked to an augmented expression of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Furthermore, mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of STAT3 exhibited poorer cardiac function, increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and a higher induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to acute DOX treatment compared with control animals. These results substantiate a model in which a p53-dependent cardioprotective mechanism, mediated by STAT3 activation, alleviates myocardial stress induced by DOX during drug delivery. The data additionally provide insight into how p53 inhibition might confer cardioprotection during treatment but, paradoxically, intensify cardiotoxicity long after drug cessation.",1,1,1,1
"The Role of P53 Inhibition in Modulating Doxorubicin Cardiotoxicity Progression. Doxorubicin (DOX) is a highly effective antineoplastic agent, yet its utility is constrained by both acute and insidious late-stage cardiotoxicity, with pediatric patients showing particular susceptibility to cardiac failure. This research investigated the influence of p53 inhibition on the development of acute versus late-stage DOX-induced cardiotoxicity in a juvenile animal model. Experiments involved two-week-old MHC-CB7 mice, which express dominant-interfering p53 specifically in cardiomyocytes, and their non-transgenic littermates. All animals received weekly DOX injections over 5 weeks, culminating in a 25 mg/kg cumulative dose. At one week following the final DOX administration (acute phase), MHC-CB7 mice demonstrated improved cardiac performance and reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in comparison to non-transgenic mice. However, by 13 weeks post-treatment (late phase), MHC-CB7 mice displayed a progressive decline in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when juxtaposed with non-transgenic controls. P53 inhibition in MHC-CB7 mice was observed to block the transient activation of STAT3 induced by DOX, a phenomenon associated with an enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80. Additionally, mice with cardiomyocyte-restricted STAT3 deletion exhibited poorer cardiac function, elevated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage compared to control animals. These findings support a conceptual framework wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway, facilitated by STAT3 activation, attenuates DOX-induced myocardial stress during the period of drug administration. Furthermore, these data propose a mechanism explaining how p53 inhibition might lead to cardioprotection during drug treatment, yet paradoxically intensify cardiotoxicity considerably after the cessation of therapy.",1,1,1,1
"The Role of Alpha-Fluoro-Beta-Alanine in 5-Fluorouracil-Induced Cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity represents an infrequent complication during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy for malignancies. We present the case of a 70-year-old male who developed 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, characterized by an elevated serum concentration of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). This patient, diagnosed with unresectable liver and lung metastases from colon cancer, had no prior cardiac history when referred for chemotherapy. Following admission, a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day) was administered, which coincided with the onset of precordial pain and a right bundle branch block, alongside a significantly high serum FBAL level of 1955 ng/ml. Both the chest pain and electrocardiographic abnormalities spontaneously resolved upon cessation of 5-FU. Given that the precordial pain was attributed to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, 5-FU administration was discontinued. Subsequently, oral S-1, a 5-FU derivative, was initiated at 200 mg/day twice weekly. S-1 is known for its potent inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for metabolizing 5-FU into FBAL. Post-S-1 initiation, the serum FBAL concentration declined to 352 ng/ml, mirroring the level observed on the first day of S-1 treatment. No further cardiac symptoms were reported. Six months into S-1 therapy, the patient achieved a partial response. This case, supported by a literature review, indicates a potential link between FBAL and 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, suggesting S-1 as a potentially safe alternative for patients experiencing such adverse effects.",1,1,1,1
"Alpha-Fluoro-Beta-Alanine and 5-Fluorouracil Cardiotoxicity: A Case Report and Therapeutic Implications. Cardiotoxicity is a rare but documented side effect associated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for cancer. This report details the case of a 70-year-old man who experienced 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, notably accompanied by a markedly elevated serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). The patient, presenting with unresectable colon cancer metastasized to the liver and lung and no history of cardiac disease, was referred for chemotherapy. During a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day) post-admission, he developed precordial pain and a right bundle branch block, concurrent with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both cardiac symptoms and electrocardiographic changes spontaneously subsided after 5-FU discontinuation. Given the presumed causality of 5-FU in the observed cardiotoxicity, the drug was withdrawn. As an alternative, oral S-1, a 5-FU derivative known to strongly inhibit dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (the enzyme that catabolizes 5-FU to FBAL), was administered at 200 mg/day twice weekly. The patient's serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng/ml, identical to its level on the initial day of S-1 administration. No subsequent cardiac manifestations were noted, and a partial response was achieved six months after starting S-1 therapy. This case experience, combined with a review of existing literature, implies a relationship between FBAL and 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, and further suggests that S-1 could be safely administered to patients with this complication.",1,1,1,1
"Clinical Evidence for Alpha-Fluoro-Beta-Alanine Involvement in 5-Fluorouracil Cardiotoxicity and S-1 Management. The occurrence of cardiotoxicity during 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment for malignancies is an infrequent adverse event. We present a clinical case involving a 70-year-old male with 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity who exhibited a significantly elevated serum concentration of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). The patient, with unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung and no pre-existing cardiac conditions, was admitted for chemotherapy. Following the initiation of a continuous intravenous 5-FU infusion (1000 mg/day), he experienced precordial pain and a right bundle branch block, correlating with a high serum FBAL level of 1955 ng/ml. Both the chest pain and the electrocardiographic abnormalities resolved spontaneously upon cessation of 5-FU. Considering the causal link between 5-FU and the cardiac symptoms, 5-FU administration was halted. Oral S-1, a derivative of 5-FU, was then prescribed at 200 mg/day twice weekly. S-1 effectively inhibits dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the metabolic degradation of 5-FU into FBAL. Subsequently, the serum FBAL concentration decreased to 352 ng/ml, matching the value recorded on the first day of S-1 treatment. The patient remained free of cardiac symptoms thereafter and achieved a partial response after six months of S-1 treatment. This patient's experience, corroborated by a literature review, proposes a connection between FBAL and 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity and suggests the safe use of S-1 in patients affected by this condition.",1,1,1,1
"Investigating the Link Between Alpha-Fluoro-Beta-Alanine and 5-Fluorouracil Cardiotoxicity. Cardiotoxicity is an uncommon complication observed during the therapeutic administration of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for various malignancies. This report details the clinical presentation of a 70-year-old man who developed 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, concurrent with a markedly elevated serum level of alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). The patient, without a history of cardiac disease, had unresectable colon cancer with liver and lung metastases and was admitted for chemotherapy. Following the initiation of a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU (1000 mg/day), he presented with precordial pain and right bundle branch block, coinciding with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng/ml. Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes spontaneously resolved upon discontinuation of 5-FU. As the patient's precordial pain was attributed to 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity, 5-FU treatment was ceased. Subsequently, an alternative regimen of oral S-1 (a 5-FU derivative) was commenced at 200 mg/day twice weekly, chosen for its potent inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the degradation of 5-FU into FBAL. This intervention led to a decrease in serum FBAL concentration to 352 ng/ml, identical to the measurement on the initial day of S-1 administration. No further cardiac symptoms were observed, and the patient achieved a partial response within six months of starting S-1. Based on this case and a review of existing literature, a strong association between FBAL and 5-FU-induced cardiotoxicity is implied, suggesting S-1 as a viable and safe therapeutic option for affected individuals.",1,1,1,1
"The Impact of Combined Adriamycin and Whole Body Hyperthermia on Neoplastic and Healthy Tissues. A comparative analysis was conducted in a F344 rat model to assess the thermal potentiation of Adriamycin's antineoplastic efficacy and associated normal tissue adverse effects by whole body hyperthermia. Antitumor effects were evaluated through a tumor growth delay assay. Acute normal tissue toxicities, specifically leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, along with late toxicities such as myocardial and kidney injury, were assessed using functional/physiological and morphological methodologies, respectively. Whole body hyperthermia (120 minutes at 41.5°C) augmented both the antineoplastic action of Adriamycin and its deleterious side effects. The thermal enhancement ratio (TER) for antineoplastic activity was determined to be 1.6. TERs for acute hematological alterations were estimated at 1.3, while those for late damage, identified through morphological cardiac and renal lesions, ranged from 2.4 to 4.3.

"Contrast-Induced Nephropathy Rates in Inpatient Oncology Populations. This study aimed to ascertain the prevalence and associated factors of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) among hospitalized cancer patients. Ninety adult patients were included, excluding those with existing acute renal failure risk factors. Serum creatinine (Cr) levels were measured the day prior to contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and daily for three subsequent days. CIN was defined by a Cr increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl or a rise of 25% or more from baseline. The investigation revealed CIN in 18 out of 90 (20%) patients. The condition was observed in 25.5% of chemotherapy recipients versus 11% of non-chemotherapy recipients (P = 0.1). A significantly higher incidence of CIN occurred when CT was performed within 45 days of the last chemotherapy session (P = 0.005), which was also identified as an independent risk factor (P = 0.017). Furthermore, CIN was significantly more frequent following bevacizumab/irinotecan treatment (P = 0.021) and in patients with hypertension (P = 0.044).

"Anemia in Hepatitis C Virus Patients: Characterization and Therapeutic Approaches. Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage liver disease. The gold standard for HCV treatment is combination therapy involving pegylated interferon and ribavirin. This regimen achieves sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of individuals but can induce a dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. The primary cause of hemoglobin reduction is ribavirin-mediated hemolysis, and this anemia poses significant challenges, particularly for HCV patients with coexisting renal or cardiovascular conditions. Anemia generally elevates the risk of morbidity and mortality, alongside detrimental effects on cognitive function and quality of life. While ribavirin-associated anemia can be mitigated by dose reduction or cessation, such strategies adversely impact treatment outcomes by markedly lowering SVR rates. Although recombinant human erythropoietin has been employed to address ribavirin-induced anemia, it carries other potential drawbacks. Viramidine, a ribavirin prodrug specifically targeting the liver, offers the prospect of maintaining ribavirin's virologic effectiveness while simultaneously decreasing the incidence of hemolytic anemia in chronic hepatitis C patients.",1,1,0,1
"Clinical Significance and Management Strategies for Anemia in Hepatitis C Virus Infection. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic infection can advance to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and end-stage hepatic disease. The most effective current treatment for HCV infection utilizes a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Despite achieving sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in about half of all patients, this regimen may lead to a hemolytic anemia that restricts dosage. Hemoglobin levels primarily decline due to ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemic state is a concern for patients with HCV, particularly those also suffering from renal or cardiovascular comorbidities. Broadly, anemia contributes to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, and can negatively affect cerebral performance and overall quality of life. Although anemia linked to ribavirin can be reversed through dosage reduction or discontinuation, this approach compromises treatment success by substantially lowering SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been used for ribavirin-associated anemia but presents its own disadvantages. Viramidine, a prodrug of ribavirin designed to target the liver, shows potential to sustain the antiviral efficacy of ribavirin while reducing the likelihood of hemolytic anemia in individuals with chronic hepatitis C.",1,1,0,1
"Understanding and Addressing Anemia in Hepatitis C Virus-Infected Individuals. Persistent infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) can progress to severe conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and terminal liver disease. The optimal current therapy for HCV involves co-administration of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. While this dual therapy yields sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in approximately 50% of subjects, it can precipitate a dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. The primary mechanism for reduced hemoglobin concentration is ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia represents a clinical challenge for HCV-infected patients, especially those with concurrent renal or cardiovascular impairments. Anemia, in general, is associated with heightened risks of morbidity and mortality, and can exert detrimental effects on brain function and patient quality of life. Though ribavirin-related anemia is reversible via dose modification or cessation, this strategy compromises treatment outcomes by significantly diminishing SVR rates. The use of recombinant human erythropoietin to manage ribavirin-associated anemia is an option but possesses other drawbacks. Viramidine, a liver-specific prodrug of ribavirin, offers the potential to preserve ribavirin's virologic efficacy while simultaneously mitigating the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis C.",1,1,0,1

This regimen achieves sustained virologic responses (SVRs) in about half of treated individuals, yet it is frequently linked to a potentially dose-limiting hemolytic anemia. The decline in hemoglobin levels is predominantly a consequence of ribavirin-induced hemolysis, and this anemia can pose substantial difficulties for patients with HCV infection, particularly if they have comorbid renal or cardiovascular conditions. Generally, anemia heightens the potential for morbidity and mortality and can negatively impact cognitive abilities and quality of daily living. While ribavirin-induced anemia can be resolved by reducing or stopping the dose, this tactic undermines favorable outcomes by considerably decreasing SVR rates. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been employed to address ribavirin-related anemia, but it introduces other potential disadvantages. Viramidine, a prodrug of ribavirin designed for hepatic targeting, holds promise for maintaining the virologic effectiveness of ribavirin while simultaneously lowering the incidence of hemolytic anemia in individuals with chronic hepatitis C.",1,1,0,1
"Doxorubicin's Efficacy and Systemic Toxicities in LOU/M/WSL Rats with IgM Solid Immunocytoma. The antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin were investigated in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats harboring a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals bearing tumors, which measured 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm in diameter, received intravenous doxorubicin daily for five days, followed by weekly injections for seven weeks, covering a dose range of 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body weight. Tumor regression was evident at 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, with complete tumor eradication achieved at 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histological examination revealed Grade III cardiotoxicity exclusively at the 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg dose. Renal damage, observable via light microscopy, manifested at doses exceeding 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, leading to albuminuria and severely reduced serum albumin levels. Specifically, at 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, serum albumin levels decreased from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Concurrent observations included ascites and hydrothorax. Parallel experiments in non-tumor-bearing rats showed no significant differences in these toxicities. In conclusion, the antitumor efficacy, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin were concurrently assessed in the LOU/M/WSL rat model. Renal damage-induced albuminuria, causing profound reductions in serum albumin, suggested that ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily sequelae of the observed cardiomyopathy.",1,1,0,1
"Evaluation of Doxorubicin's Antineoplastic Action, Cardiac, and Renal Toxicity in the IgM Immunocytoma-Afflicted LOU/M/WSL Rat. This study examined doxorubicin's antineoplastic efficacy, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats, each inoculated with a solid IgM immunocytoma. Tumor-bearing animals, with an average tumor diameter of 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm, underwent intravenous doxorubicin treatment, administered over 5 consecutive days, then weekly for 7 weeks (dose range: 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt). A doxorubicin dose of 0.5 mg/kg induced tumor regression, while a 1.0 mg/kg dose resulted in complete tumor disappearance. Histopathologic evidence of cardiotoxicity, graded as III, was exclusively noted at the 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg dose. Light microscopic signs of kidney injury emerged at doxorubicin doses above 0.5 mg/kg, manifesting as albuminuria and markedly low serum albumin concentrations. In the 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg treatment group, serum albumin levels declined from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Simultaneously, ascites and hydrothorax were observed. Identical experiments conducted on rats without tumors demonstrated no substantial variations in these effects. In summary, doxorubicin's antitumor effects, cardiac, and renal toxicities were concurrently investigated in the LOU/M/WSL rat model. The severe reduction in serum albumin caused by renal damage-induced albuminuria indicated that ascites and hydrothorax were not solely attributable to the observed cardiomyopathy.",1,1,0,1
"Assessment of Doxorubicin's Therapeutic Efficacy and Organ Toxicities in LOU/M/WSL Rats Bearing IgM Solid Immunocytomas. The therapeutic efficacy against tumors, along with cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, induced by doxorubicin, was investigated in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats bearing a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. These animals, with an initial tumor diameter of 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm, received doxorubicin via intravenous injections for 5 consecutive days, followed by a weekly injection for 7 weeks, across a dose spectrum of 0.015-4.0 mg/kg body wt. Tumor regression was evident following treatment with 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, and complete tumor resolution was achieved with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Grade III cardiotoxicity, confirmed histologically, occurred solely at the 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg dose. Renal damage, identified through light microscopy, became apparent at doxorubicin doses exceeding 0.5 mg/kg, leading to albuminuria and significantly diminished serum albumin levels. For rats administered 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, serum albumin levels dramatically fell from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter. Concurrently, ascites and hydrothorax were noted. Control experiments involving non-tumor-bearing rats showed no major discrepancies in these findings. Overall, the antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin were simultaneously evaluated in the LOU/M/WSL rat model. The albuminuria resulting from renal damage, causing extremely low serum albumin, indicated that ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily a direct consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy.",1,1,0,1
"Investigating Doxorubicin's Antitumor, Cardiotoxic, and Nephrotoxic Effects in the LOU/M/WSL Rat Model with IgM Solid Immunocytoma. A study was conducted to ascertain the antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in LOU/M/WSL inbred rats, which were all engrafted with a transplantable solid IgM immunocytoma. Animals presenting with tumors (average diameter of 15.8 +/- 3.3 mm) received doxorubicin through intravenous injections, initially for 5 consecutive days, then weekly for 7 weeks, with doses ranging from 0.015 to 4.0 mg/kg body weight. Tumor regression was observed with a doxorubicin dose of 0.5 mg/kg, and complete tumor disappearance was achieved at 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg. Histological signs of cardiotoxicity, graded as III, were exclusively evident at the 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg dose. Light microscopic examination revealed evidence of renal damage at doses above 0.5 mg doxorubicin/kg, culminating in albuminuria and extremely low serum albumin levels. In the cohort treated with 1.0 mg doxorubicin/kg, a reduction in serum albumin levels from 33.6 +/- 4.1 to 1.5 +/- 0.5 g/liter was recorded. Ascites and hydrothorax were concurrently identified. Identical experiments performed on rats without tumors did not reveal significant differences in these adverse effects. The simultaneous study in LOU/M/WSL rats allowed for a comprehensive understanding of doxorubicin's antitumor activity, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. It was concluded that albuminuria, stemming from renal damage and resulting in profoundly low serum albumin levels, meant that ascites and hydrothorax were not necessarily due to the observed cardiomyopathy.",1,1,0,1
